<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct,
<br>
The grave is ready for me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Surely there are mockers with me,
<br>
And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself;
<br>
Who is there that will strike hands with me?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For thou hast hid their heart from understanding:
<br>
Therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> He that denounceth his friends for a prey,
<br>
Even the eyes of his children shall fail.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But he hath made me a byword of the people;
<br>
And they spit in my face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow,
<br>
And all my members are as a shadow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Upright men shall be astonished at this,
<br>
And the innocent shall stir up himself against the Godless.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Yet shall the righteous hold on his way,
<br>
And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But as for you all, come on now again;
<br>
And I shall not find a wise man among you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> My days are past, my purposes are broken off,
<br>
Even the thoughts of my heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> They change the night into day:
<br>
The light, say they, is near unto the darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> If I look for Sheol as my house;
<br>
If I have spread my couch in the darkness;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father;
<br>
To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Where then is my hope?
<br>
And as for my hope, who shall see it?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> It shall go down to the bars of Sheol,
<br>
When once there is rest in the dust.
