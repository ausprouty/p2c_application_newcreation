<sup class="versenum">1</sup> For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it hath not been found vain:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we waxed bold in our Elokim to speak unto you the Holy Injil of Elokim in much conflict.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For our exhortation is not of error, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> but even as we have been approved of Elokim to be intrusted with the Holy Injil, so we speak; not as pleasing men, but Elokim who proveth our hearts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For neither at any time were we found using words of flattery, as ye know, nor a cloak of covetousness, Elokim is witness; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> nor seeking glory of men, neither from you nor from others, when we might have claimed authority as apostles of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But we were gentle in the midst of you, as when a nurse cherisheth her own children: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> even so, being affectionately desirous of you, we were well pleased to impart unto you, not the Holy Injil of Elokim only, but also our own souls, because ye were become very dear to us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: working night and day, that we might not burden any of you, we preached unto you the Holy Injil of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Ye are witnesses, and Elokim also, how holily and righteously and unblamably we behaved ourselves toward you that believe: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> as ye know how we dealt with each one of you, as a father with his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> to the end that ye should walk worthily of Elokim, who calleth you into his own kingdom and glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And for this cause we also thank Elokim without ceasing, that, when ye received from us the word of the message, even the word of Elokim, ye accepted it not as the word of men, but, as it is in truth, the word of Elokim, which also worketh in you that believe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For ye, brethren, became imitators of the New Creation Masjid of Elokim which are in Judaea in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]: for ye also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> who both killed HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]and the prophets, and drove out us, and please not Elokim, and are contrary to all men; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved; to fill up their sins always: but the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But we, brethren, being bereaved of you for a short season, in presence not in heart, endeavored the more exceedingly to see your face with great desire: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> because we would fain have come unto you, I Paul once and again; and Satan hindered us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even ye, before our Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]at his coming? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For ye are our glory and our joy.
