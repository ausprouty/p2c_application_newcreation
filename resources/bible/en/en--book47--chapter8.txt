<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the grace of Elokim which hath been given in the New Creation Masjid of Macedonia;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> how that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For according to their power, I bear witness, yea and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> beseeching us with much entreaty in regard of this grace and the fellowship in the ministering to the saints: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and this, not as we had hoped, but first they gave their own selves to HaAdon, and to us through the will of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had made a beginning before, so he would also complete in you this grace also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But as ye abound in everything, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all earnestness, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I speak not by way of commandment, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity also of your love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For ye know the grace of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might become rich.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And herein I give my judgment: for this is expedient for you, who were the first to make a beginning a year ago, not only to do, but also to will.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But now complete the doing also; that as there was the readiness to will, so there may be the completion also out of your ability.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man hath, not according as he hath not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For I say not this that others may be eased and ye distressed; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> but by equality: your abundance being a supply at this present time for their want, that their abundance also may become a supply for your want; that there may be equality: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> as it is written, He that gathered much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But thanks be to Elokim, who putteth the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For he accepted indeed our exhortation; but being himself very earnest, he went forth unto you of his own accord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And we have sent together with him the brother whose praise in the Holy Injil is spread through all the New Creation Masjid; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and not only so, but who was also appointed by the New Creation Masjid to travel with us in the matter of this grace, which is ministered by us to the glory of HaAdon, and to show our readiness: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> avoiding this, that any man should blame us in the matter of this bounty which is ministered by us: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> for we take thought for things honorable, not only in the sight of HaAdon, but also in the sight of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest, by reason of the great confidence which he hath in you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Whether any inquire about Titus, he is my partner and my fellow-worker to you-ward; or our brethren, they are the messengers of the New Creation Masjid, they are the glory of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Show ye therefore unto them in the face of the New Creation Masjid the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf.
