<sup class="versenum">1</sup> For we know that if the earthly house of our tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building from Elokim, a house not made with hands, eternal, in the heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For verily in this we groan, longing to be clothed upon with our habitation which is from heaven: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For indeed we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened; not for that we would be unclothed, but that we would be clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up of life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Now he that wrought us for this very thing is Elokim, who gave unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Being therefore always of good courage, and knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from HaAdon 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> (for we walk by faith, not by sight); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> we are of good courage, I say, and are willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home with HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Wherefore also we make it our aim, whether at home or absent, to be well-pleasing unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For we must all be made manifest before the judgment-seat of Al-Masih; that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Knowing therefore the fear of HaAdon, we persuade men, but we are made manifest unto Elokim; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> We are not again commending ourselves unto you, but speak as giving you occasion of glorying on our behalf, that ye may have wherewith to answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For whether we are beside ourselves, it is unto Elokim; or whether we are of sober mind, it is unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For the love of Al-Masih constraineth us; because we thus judge, that one died for all, therefore all died; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and he died for all, that they that live should no longer live unto themselves, but unto him who for their sakes died and rose again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Wherefore we henceforth know no man after the flesh: even though we have known Al-Masih after the flesh, yet now we know him so no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Wherefore if any man is in Al-Masih, he is a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold, they are become new [New Creation Submitters to G-d, T.N. See Sura 14:19. See 2 Kings 5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that God can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (Romans 6:3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .]
<br>

<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But all things are of Elokim, who reconciled us to himself through al-Masih, and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> to wit, that Elokim was in Al-Masih reconciling the world unto himself, not reckoning unto them their trespasses, and having committed unto us the word of reconciliation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> We are ambassadors therefore on behalf of Al-Masih, as though Elokim were entreating by us: we beseech you on behalf of Al-Masih, be ye reconciled to Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Him who knew no sin he made to be sin on our behalf; that we might become the righteousness of Elokim in him.
