<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now Ya’qub (Jacob) saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Ya’qub (Jacob) said unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Yusuf’s ten brethren went down to buy grain from Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But Benjamin, Yusuf’s brother, Ya’qub (Jacob) sent not with his brethren; for he said, Lest Peradventure harm befall him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came: for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) was the governor over the land; he it was that sold to all the people of the land.
<br>
 And Yusuf’s brethren came, and bowed down themselves to him with their faces to the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himself strange unto them, and spoke roughly with them; and he said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) knew his brethren, but they knew not him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy servants come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> We are all one man’s sons; we are true men, thy servants are no spies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And they said, We thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) said unto them, That is it that I spoke unto you, saying, Ye are spies: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> hereby ye shall be proved: by the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall be bound, that your words may be proved, whether there be truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And he put them all together into ward three days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) said unto them the third day, This do, and live; for I fear Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> if ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in your prison-house; but go ye, carry grain for the famine of your houses: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die.
<br>
 And they did so.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Reuben answered them, saying, Spoke I not unto you, saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear? therefore also, behold, his blood is required.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And they knew not that Yusuf (Joseph) understood them; for there was an interpreter between them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and he returned to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them, and bound him before their eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Then Yusuf (Joseph) commanded to fill their vessels with grain, and to restore every man’s money into his sack, and to give them provision for the way: and thus was it done unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And they laded their asses with their grain, and departed thence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the lodging-place, he espied his money; and, behold, it was in the mouth of his sack.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo, it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they turned trembling one to another, saying, What is this that Elokim hath done unto us? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And they came unto Ya’qub (Jacob) their father unto the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> The man, HaAdon of the land, spoke roughly with us, and took us for spies of the country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> we are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And the man, HaAdon of the land, said unto us, Hereby shall I know that ye are true men: leave one of your brethren with me, and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> and bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffic in the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man’s bundle of money was in his sack: and when they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of my children: Yusuf (Joseph) is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he only is left: if harm befall him by the way in which ye go, then will ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.
