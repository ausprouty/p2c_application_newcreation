<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of Asaph) Sing aloud unto Elokim our strength:
<br>
Make a joyful noise unto the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Raise a song, and bring hither the timbrel,
<br>
The pleasant harp with the psaltery.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Blow the trumpet at the new moon,
<br>
At the full moon, on our feast-day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For it is a statute for Israel,
<br>
An ordinance of the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> He appointed it in Yusuf (Joseph) for a testimony,
<br>
When he went out over the land of Egypt,
<br>
Where I heard a language that I knew not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I removed his shoulder from the burden:
<br>
His hands were freed from the basket.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee;
<br>
I answered thee in the secret place of thunder;
<br>
I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee:
<br>
O Israel, if thou wouldest hearken unto me!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> There shall no strange Elokim be in thee;
<br>
Neither shalt thou worship any foreign Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I am تتراجراماتون thy Elokim,
<br>
Who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt:
<br>
Open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But my people hearkened not to my voice;
<br>
And Israel would none of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So I let them go after the stubbornness of their heart,
<br>
That they might walk in their own counsels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Oh that my people would hearken unto me,
<br>
That Israel would walk in my ways!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I would soon subdue their enemies,
<br>
And turn my hand against their adversaries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The haters of تتراجراماتون should submit themselves unto him:
<br>
But their time should endure for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> He would feed them also with the finest of the wheat;
<br>
And with honey out of the rock would I satisfy thee.
