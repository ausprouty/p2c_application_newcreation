<sup class="versenum">1</sup> For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]in behalf of you Gentiles,â€™
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of Elokim which was given me to you-ward; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote before in few words, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Al-Masih; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]through the Holy Injil, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of Elokim which was given me according to the working of his power.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Al-Masih; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which for ages hath been hid in Elokim who created all things; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the New Creation Masjid the manifold wisdom of Elokim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]our Lord: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Wherefore I ask that ye may not faint at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> that Al-Masih may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and to know the love of Al-Masih which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> unto him be the glory in the New Creation Masjid and in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]unto all generations for ever and ever.
<br>
 Amen.
