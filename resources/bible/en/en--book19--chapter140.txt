<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Dawad) Deliver me, O تتراجراماتون, from the evil man;
<br>
Preserve me from the violent man:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Who devise mischiefs in their heart;
<br>
Continually do they gather themselves together for war.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent;
<br>
Adders’ poison is under their lips.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Keep me, O تتراجراماتون, from the hands of the wicked;
<br>
Preserve me from the violent man:
<br>
Who have purposed to thrust aside my steps.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords;
<br>
They have spread a net by the wayside;
<br>
They have set gins for me.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I said unto تتراجراماتون, Thou art my Elokim:
<br>
Give ear unto the voice of my supplications, O تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> O تتراجراماتون HaAdon, the strength of my salvation,
<br>
Thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Grant not, O تتراجراماتون, the desires of the wicked;
<br>
Further not his evil device, lest they exalt themselves.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> As for the head of those that compass me about,
<br>
Let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Let burning coals fall upon them:
<br>
Let them be cast into the fire,
<br>
Into deep pits, whence they shall not rise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> An evil speaker shall not be established in the earth:
<br>
Evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I know that تتراجراماتون will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
<br>
And justice for the needy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name:
<br>
The upright shall dwell in thy presence.
