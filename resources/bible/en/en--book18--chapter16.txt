<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then Ayyub (Job) answered and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I have heard many such things:
<br>
Miserable comforters are ye all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Shall vain words have an end?
<br>
Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I also could speak as ye do;
<br>
If your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead,
<br>
I could join words together against you,
<br>
And shake my head at you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But I would strengthen you with my mouth,
<br>
And the solace of my lips would assuage your grief.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged;
<br>
And though I forbear, what am I eased?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But now he hath made me weary:
<br>
Thou hast made desolate all my company.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me:
<br>
And my leanness riseth up against me,
<br>
It testifieth to my face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me;
<br>
He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth:
<br>
Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> They have gaped upon me with their mouth;
<br>
They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully:
<br>
They gather themselves together against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Elokim delivereth me to the ungodly,
<br>
And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I was at ease, and he brake me asunder;
<br>
Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces:
<br>
He hath also set me up for his mark.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> His archers compass me round about;
<br>
He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare;
<br>
He poureth out my gall upon the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> He breaketh me with breach upon breach;
<br>
He runneth upon me like a giant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin,
<br>
And have laid my horn in the dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> My face is red with weeping,
<br>
And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Although there is no violence in my hands,
<br>
And my prayer is pure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> O earth, cover not thou my blood,
<br>
And let my cry have no resting-place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven,
<br>
And he that voucheth for me is on high.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> My friends scoff at me:
<br>
But mine eye poureth out tears unto Elokim,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> That he would maintain the right of a man with Elokim,
<br>
And of a son of man with his neighbor!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For when a few years are come,
<br>
I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
