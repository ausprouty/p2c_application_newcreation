<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned: is it profitable for any work? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Therefore thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am تتراجراماتون, when I set my face against them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون.
