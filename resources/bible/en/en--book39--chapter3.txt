<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and HaAdon [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).], whom ye seek, will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant, whom ye desire, behold, he cometh, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But who can abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner’s fire, and like fullers’ soap: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi, and refine them as gold and silver; and they shall offer unto تتراجراماتون offerings in righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto تتراجراماتون, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against the false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the sojourner from his right, and fear not me, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For I, تتراجراماتون, change not; therefore ye, O sons of Ya’qub (Jacob), are not consumed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> From the days of your fathers ye have turned aside from mine ordinances, and have not kept them.
<br>
 Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
 But ye say, Wherein shall we return? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Will a man rob Elokim? yet ye rob me.
<br>
 But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Ye are cursed with the curse; for ye rob me, even this whole nation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Bring ye the whole tithe into the store-house, that there may be food in my house, and prove me now herewith, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast its fruit before the time in the field, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And all nations shall call you happy; for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Your words have been stout against me, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
 Yet ye say, What have we spoken against thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Ye have said, It is vain to serve Elokim; and what profit is it that we have kept his charge, and that we have walked mournfully before تتراجراماتون of hosts? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are built up; yea, they tempt Elokim, and escape.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Then they that feared تتراجراماتون spoke one with another; and تتراجراماتون hearkened, and heard, and a book of remembrance was written before him, for them that feared تتراجراماتون, and that thought upon his name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And they shall be mine, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, even mine own possession, in the day that I make; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth Elokim and him that serveth him not.
