<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the New Creation Masjid of the Thessalonians in Elokim our [Atik Yomin] Father and [Bar Enosh] HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] [T.N. See Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41];
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Grace to you and Al-Salaam from Elokim the Father and HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> We are bound to give thanks to Elokim always for you, brethren, even as it is meet, for that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all toward one another aboundeth; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> so that we ourselves glory in you in the New Creation Masjid of Elokim for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions which ye endure; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of Elokim; to the end that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of Elokim, for which ye also suffer: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> if so be that it is a righteous thing with Elokim to recompense affliction to them that afflict you, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and to you that are afflicted rest with us, at the revelation of HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]from heaven with the angels of his power in flaming fire, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> rendering vengeance to them that know not Elokim, and to them that obey not the Holy Injil of our Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> who shall suffer punishment, even eternal destruction from the face of HaAdon and from the glory of his might, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be marvelled at in all them that believed (because our testimony unto you was believed) in that day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> To which end we also pray always for you, that our Elokim may count you worthy of your calling, and fulfil every desire of goodness and every work of faith, with power; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> that the name of our Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our Elokim and HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
