<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to Elokim is for them, that they may be saved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for Elokim, but not according to knowledge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For being ignorant of Elokim’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For al-Masih is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For Musa writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring al-Masih down) 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring al-Masih up from the dead.)
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that Elokim raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of HaAdon shall be saved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings.
<br>
 For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> So belief cometh of hearing, and hearing by the word of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily,
<br>
Their sound went out into all the earth,
<br>
And their words unto the ends of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But I say, Did Israel not know? First Musa saith,
<br>
I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation,
<br>
With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Isaiah is very bold, and saith,
<br>
I was found of them that sought me not;
<br>
I became manifest unto them that asked not of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
