<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Faithful is the saying, If a man seeketh the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The bishop therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, orderly, given to hospitality, apt to teach; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> no brawler, no striker; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> one that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> (but if a man knoweth not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the New Creation Masjid of Elokim?) 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> not a novice, lest being puffed up he fall into the condemnation of the devil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Moreover he must have good testimony from them that are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Deacons in like manner must be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And let these also first be proved; then let them serve as deacons, if they be blameless.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Women in like manner must be grave, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For they that have served well as deacons gain to themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> but if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how men ought to behave themselves in the house of Elokim, which is the New Creation Masjid of the living Elokim, the pillar and ground of the truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness:
<br>
Elokim was manifested in the flesh,
<br>
Vindicated (proven just) by the Holy Ruach,
<br>
Seen by angels,
<br>
Preached among the nations,
<br>
Believed on in the world,
<br>
Received up in glory [T.N. See Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41]
