<sup class="versenum">1</sup> But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of Elokim be not blasphemed: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them in all things; not gainsaying; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of Elokim our Saviour in all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For the grace of Elokim hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and Godly in this present world; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great Elokim and our Saviour [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority.
<br>
 Let no man despise thee.
