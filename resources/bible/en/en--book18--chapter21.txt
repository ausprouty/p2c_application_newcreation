<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then Ayyub (Job) answered and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hear diligently my speech;
<br>
And let this be your consolations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Suffer me, and I also will speak;
<br>
And after that I have spoken, mock on.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> As for me, is my complaint to man?
<br>
And why should I not be impatient?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Mark me, and be astonished,
<br>
And lay your hand upon your mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Even when I remember I am troubled,
<br>
And horror taketh hold on my flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Wherefore do the wicked live,
<br>
Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Their seed is established with them in their sight,
<br>
And their offspring before their eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Their houses are safe from fear,
<br>
Neither is the rod of Elokim upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Their bull gendereth, and faileth not;
<br>
Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> They send forth their little ones like a flock,
<br>
And their children dance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> They sing to the timbrel and harp,
<br>
And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> They spend their days in prosperity,
<br>
And in a moment they go down to Sheol.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And they say unto Elokim, Depart from us;
<br>
For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?
<br>
And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand:
<br>
The counsel of the wicked is far from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out?
<br>
That their calamity cometh upon them?
<br>
That Elokim distributeth sorrows in his anger?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> That they are as stubble before the wind,
<br>
And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Ye say, Elokim layeth up his iniquity for his children.
<br>
Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Let his own eyes see his destruction,
<br>
And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For what careth he for his house after him,
<br>
When the number of his months is cut off?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Shall any teach Elokim knowledge,
<br>
Seeing he judgeth those that are high?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> One dieth in his full strength,
<br>
Being wholly at ease and quiet:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> His pails are full of milk,
<br>
And the marrow of his bones is moistened.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And another dieth in bitterness of soul,
<br>
And never tasteth of good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> They lie down alike in the dust,
<br>
And the worm covereth them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Behold, I know your thoughts,
<br>
And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?
<br>
And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Have ye not asked wayfaring men?
<br>
And do ye not know their evidences,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity?
<br>
That they are led forth to the day of wrath?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Who shall declare his way to his face?
<br>
And who shall repay him what he hath done?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Yet shall he be borne to the grave,
<br>
And men shall keep watch over the tomb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him,
<br>
And all men shall draw after him,
<br>
As there were innumerable before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> How then comfort ye me in vain,
<br>
Seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?
