<sup class="versenum">1</sup> For freedom did Al-Masih set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Al-Masih will profit you nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Ye are severed from Al-Masih, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> This persuasion came not of him that calleth you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I have confidence to you-ward in HaAdon, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the Tree been done away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And they that are of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]have hanged on a Tree the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.
