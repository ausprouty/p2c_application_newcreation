<sup class="versenum">1</sup>And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy; for I تتراجراماتون your Elokim am holy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father; and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten Elokim: I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto تتراجراماتون, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of تتراجراماتون: and that soul shall be cut off from his people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, and profane the name of thy Elokim: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbor, nor rob him: the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind; but thou shalt fear thy Elokim: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbor: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbor, and not bear sin because of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people; but thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he shall bring his trespass-offering unto تتراجراماتون, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a trespass-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass-offering before تتراجراماتون for his sin which he hath sinned: and the sin which he hath sinned shall be forgiven him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Ye shall not eat anything with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy Elokim: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt: I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measures of length, of weight, or of quantity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all mine ordinances, and do them: I am تتراجراماتون.
