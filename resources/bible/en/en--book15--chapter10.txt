<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now while Uzayr (Ezra) prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of Elokim, there was gathered together unto him out of Israel a very great assembly of men and women and children; for the people wept very sore.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Uzayr (Ezra), We have trespassed against our Elokim, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land: yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Now therefore let us make a covenant with our Elokim to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our Elokim; and let it be done according to the law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Arise; for the matter belongeth unto thee, and we are with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then arose Uzayr (Ezra), and made the chiefs of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, to swear that they would do according to this word.
<br>
 So they sware.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Then Uzayr (Ezra) rose up from before the house of Elokim, and went into the chamber of Jehohanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water; for he mourned because of the trespass of them of the captivity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and that whosoever came not within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the assembly of the captivity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together unto Jerusalem within the three days (it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month); and all the people sat in the broad place before the house of Elokim, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Uzayr (Ezra) the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have trespassed, and have married foreign women, to increase the guilt of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now therefore make confession unto تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land, and from the foreign women.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, As thou hast said concerning us, so must we do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we are not able to stand without: neither is this a work of one day or two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Let now our princes be appointed for all the assembly, and let all them that are in our cities that have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our Elokim be turned from us, until this matter be despatched.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahzeiah the son of Tikvah stood up against this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite helped them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the children of the captivity did so.
<br>
 And Uzayr (Ezra) the priest, with certain heads of fathers’ houses, after their fathers’ houses, and all of them by their names, were set apart; and they sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And they made an end with all the men that had married foreign women by the first day of the first month.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And among the sons of the priests there were found that had married foreign women: namely, of the sons of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren, Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib, and Gedaliah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And they gave their hand that they would put away their wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt.
<br>

<br>
