<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Whither is thy beloved gone,
<br>
O thou fairest among women?
<br>
Whither hath thy beloved turned him,
<br>
That we may seek him with thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> My beloved is gone down to his garden,
<br>
To the beds of spices,
<br>
To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I am my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved is mine;
<br>
He feedeth his flock among the lilies,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thou art fair, O my love, as Tirzah,
<br>
Comely as Jerusalem,
<br>
Terrible as an army with banners.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Turn away thine eyes from me,
<br>
For they have overcome me.
<br>
Thy hair is as a flock of goats,
<br>
That lie along the side of Gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes,
<br>
Which are come up from the washing;
<br>
Whereof every one hath twins,
<br>
And none is bereaved among them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate
<br>
Behind thy veil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines,
<br>
And virgins [T.N. same word Isaiah 7:14] without number.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> My dove, my undefiled, is but one;
<br>
She is the only one of her mother;
<br>
She is the choice one of her that bare her.
<br>
The daughters saw her, and called her blessed;
<br>
Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Who is she that looketh forth as the morning,
<br>
Fair as the moon,
<br>
Clear as the sun,
<br>
Terrible as an army with banners?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I went down into the garden of nuts,
<br>
To see the green plants of the valley,
<br>
To see whether the vine budded,
<br>
And the pomegranates were in flower.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Before I was aware, my soul set me
<br>
Among the chariots of my princely people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Return, return, O Shulammite;
<br>
Return, return, that we may look upon thee.
<br>
Why will ye look upon the Shulammite,
<br>
As upon the dance of Mahanaim?
<br>
