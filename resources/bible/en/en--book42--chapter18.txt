<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he spoke a parable unto them to the end that they ought always to pray, and not to faint;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> saying, There was in a city a judge, who feared not Elokim, and regarded not man: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and there was a widow in that city; and she came oft unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not Elokim, nor regard man; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest she wear me out by her continual coming.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And HaAdon said, Hear what the unrighteous judge saith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And shall not Elokim avenge his elect, that cry to him day and night, and yet he is longsuffering over them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I say unto you, that he will avenge them speedily.
<br>
 Nevertheless, when the Bar Enosh cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he spoke also this parable unto certain who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and set all others at nought: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, Elokim, I thank thee, that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I fast twice in the week; I give tithes of all that I get.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote his breast, saying, Elokim, be thou merciful to me a sinner.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I say unto you, This man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled; but he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And they were bringing unto him also their babes, that he should touch them: but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]called them unto him, saying, Allow the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for to such belongeth the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of Elokim as a little child, he shall in no wise enter therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, even Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor thy father and mother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he said, All these things have I observed from my youth up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]heard it, he said unto him, One thing thou lackest yet: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But when he heard these things, he became exceeding sorrowful; for he was very rich.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]seeing him said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of Elokim! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For it is easier for a camel to enter in through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And they that heard it said, Then who can be saved? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Peter said, Lo, we have left our own, and followed thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or wife, or brethren, or parents, or children, for the kingdom of Elokim’s sake, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> who shall not receive manifold more in this time, and in the world to come eternal life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written through the prophets shall be accomplished unto the Bar Enosh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For he shall be delivered up unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully treated, and spit upon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> and they shall scourge and kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And they understood none of these things; and this saying was hid from them, and they perceived not the things that were said.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And it came to pass, as he drew nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> and hearing a multitude going by, he inquired what this meant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And they told him, that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]of Nazareth passeth by.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And he cried, saying, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], thou son of David (Dawad), have mercy on me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And they that went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out the more a great deal, Thou son of David (Dawad), have mercy on me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying Elokim: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto Elokim.
