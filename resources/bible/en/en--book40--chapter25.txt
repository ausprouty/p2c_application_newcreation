<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For it is as when a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> In like manner he also that received the two gained other two.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lordâ€™s money.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And he also that received the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> But when the Bar Enosh shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.
