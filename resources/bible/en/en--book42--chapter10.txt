<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now after these things HaAdon appointed seventy others, and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place, whither he himself was about to come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he said unto them, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few: pray ye therefore HaAdon of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Go your ways; behold, I send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Carry no purse, no wallet, no shoes; and salute no man on the way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And into whatsoever house ye shall enter, first say, Peace be to this house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And if a son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall turn to you again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And in that same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire.
<br>
 Go not from house to house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of Elokim is come nigh unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But into whatsoever city ye shall enter, and they receive you not, go out into the streets thereof and say, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Even the dust from your city, that cleaveth to our feet, we wipe off against you: nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of Elokim is come nigh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which were done in you, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment, than for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt be brought down unto Hades.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> He that heareth you heareth me; and he that rejecteth you rejecteth me; and he that rejecteth me rejecteth him that sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he said unto them, I beheld Satan fallen as lightning from heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Behold, I have given you authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall in any wise hurt you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Nevertheless in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Ruach, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou didst hide these things from the wise and understanding, and didst reveal them unto babes: yea, Father; for so it was well-pleasing in thy sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> All things have been delivered unto me of my Father: and no one knoweth who the Son is, save the Father; and who the Father is, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] willeth to reveal him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And turning to the disciples, he said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> for I say unto you, that many prophets and kings desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and made trial of him, saying, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And he said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And he answering said, Thou shalt love HaAdon thy Elokim with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], And who is my neighbor? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]made answer and said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho; and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And in like manner a Levite also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> and came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on them oil and wine; and he set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And on the morrow he took out two shillings, and gave them to the host, and said, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, I, when I come back again, will repay thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Which of these three, thinkest thou, proved neighbor unto him that fell among the robbers? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And he said, He that showed mercy on him.
<br>
 And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Go, and do thou likewise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Now as they went on their way, he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at HaAdonâ€™s feet, and heard his word.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> But Martha was cumbered about much serving; and she came up to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister did leave me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> But HaAdon answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> but one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
