<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah) تتراجراماتون, thou hast been favorable unto thy land;
<br>
Thou hast brought back the captivity of Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people;
<br>
Thou hast covered all their sin.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou hast taken away all thy wrath;
<br>
Thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Turn us, O Elokim of our salvation,
<br>
And cause thine indignation toward us to cease.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Wilt thou be angry with us for ever?
<br>
Wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Wilt thou not quicken us again,
<br>
That thy people may rejoice in thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Show us thy lovingkindness, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And grant us thy salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I will hear what Elokim تتراجراماتون will speak;
<br>
For he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints:
<br>
But let them not turn again to folly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him,
<br>
That glory may dwell in our land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Mercy and truth are met together;
<br>
Righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Truth springeth out of the earth;
<br>
And righteousness hath looked down from heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Yea, تتراجراماتون will give that which is good;
<br>
And our land shall yield its increase.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Righteousness shall go before him,
<br>
And shall make his footsteps a way to walk in.
