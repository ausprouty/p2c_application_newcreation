<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born unto them,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> that the sons of Elokim saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all that they chose.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And تتراجراماتون said, My Spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh: yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of Elokim came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And تتراجراماتون saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And it repented تتراجراماتون that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And تتراجراماتون said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground; both man, and beast, and creeping things, and birds of the heavens; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But Noah found favor in the eyes of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, and perfect in his generations: Noah walked with Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the earth was corrupt before Elokim, and the earth was filled with violence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Elokim saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Elokim said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And this is how thou shalt make it: the length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> A light shalt thou make to the ark, and to a cubit shalt thou finish it upward; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And I, behold, I do bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; everything that is in the earth shall die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Of the birds after their kind, and of the cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Thus did Noah; according to all that Elokim commanded him, so did he.
