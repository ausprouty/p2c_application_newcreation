<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Moreover Elihu answered and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hear my words, ye wise men;
<br>
And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For the ear trieth words,
<br>
As the palate tasteth food.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Let us choose for us that which is right:
<br>
Let us know among ourselves what is good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For Ayyub (Job) hath said, I am righteous,
<br>
And Elokim hath taken away my right:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar;
<br>
My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> What man is like Ayyub (Job),
<br>
Who drinketh up scoffing like water,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity,
<br>
And walketh with wicked men?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing
<br>
That he should delight himself with Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding:
<br>
Far be it from Elokim, that he should do wickedness,
<br>
And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For the work of a man will he render unto him,
<br>
And cause every man to find according to his ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Yea, of a surety, Elokim will not do wickedly,
<br>
Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Who gave him a charge over the earth?
<br>
Or who hath disposed the whole world?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> If he set his heart upon himself,
<br>
If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> All flesh shall perish together,
<br>
And man shall turn again unto dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> If now thou hast understanding, hear this:
<br>
Hearken to the voice of my words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Shall even one that hateth justice govern?
<br>
And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty?â€™
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Him that saith to a king, Thou art vile,
<br>
Or to nobles, Ye are wicked;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> That respecteth not the persons of princes,
<br>
Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor;
<br>
For they all are the work of his hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> In a moment they die, even at midnight;
<br>
The people are shaken and pass away,
<br>
And the mighty are taken away without hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For his eyes are upon the ways of a man,
<br>
And he seeth all his goings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> There is no darkness, nor thick gloom,
<br>
Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For he needeth not further to consider a man,
<br>
That he should go before Elokim in judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out,
<br>
And setteth others in their stead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works;
<br>
And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> He striketh them as wicked men
<br>
In the open sight of others;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Because they turned aside from following him,
<br>
And would not have regard in any of his ways:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him,
<br>
And he heard the cry of the afflicted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn?
<br>
And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?
<br>
Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> That the Godless man reign not,
<br>
That there be none to ensnare the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> For hath any said unto Elokim,
<br>
I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> That which I see not teach thou me:
<br>
If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it?
<br>
For thou must choose, and not I:
<br>
Therefore speak what thou knowest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Men of understanding will say unto me,
<br>
Yea, every wise man that heareth me:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Ayyub (Job) speaketh without knowledge,
<br>
And his words are without wisdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Would that Ayyub (Job) were tried unto the end,
<br>
Because of his answering like wicked men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> For he addeth rebellion unto his sin;
<br>
He clappeth his hands among us,
<br>
And multiplieth his words against Elokim.
