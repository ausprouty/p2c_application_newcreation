<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?
<br>
But who can withhold himself from speaking?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Behold, thou hast instructed many,
<br>
And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thy words have upholden him that was falling,
<br>
And thou hast made firm the feeble knees.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest;
<br>
It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Is not thy fear of Elokim thy confidence,
<br>
And the integrity of thy ways thy hope?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?
<br>
Or where were the upright cut off?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity,
<br>
And sow trouble, reap the same.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> By the breath of Elokim they perish,
<br>
And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,
<br>
And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey,
<br>
And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Now a thing was secretly brought to me,
<br>
And mine ear received a whisper thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> In thoughts from the visions of the night,
<br>
When deep sleep falleth on men,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Fear came upon me, and trembling,
<br>
Which made all my bones to shake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then a spirit passed before my face;
<br>
The hair of my flesh stood up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof;
<br>
A form was before mine eyes:
<br>
There was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Shall mortal man be more just than Elokim?
<br>
Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants;
<br>
And his angels he chargeth with folly:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> How much more them that dwell in houses of clay,
<br>
Whose foundation is in the dust,
<br>
Who are crushed before the moth!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed:
<br>
They perish for ever without any regarding it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them?
<br>
They die, and that without wisdom.
