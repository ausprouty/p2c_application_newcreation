<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون; and تتراجراماتون delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون appeared unto the woman, and said unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not; but thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> for, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come upon his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto Elokim from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of Elokim came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the angel of Elokim, very terrible; and I asked him not whence he was, neither told he me his name: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite unto Elokim from the womb to the day of his death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then Manoah entreated تتراجراماتون, and said, Oh, Lord, I pray thee, let the man of Elokim whom thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Elokim hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of Elokim came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto me the other day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spokest unto the woman? And he said, I am.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and how shall we do unto him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> She may not eat of anything that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her observe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Manoah said unto the angel of تتراجراماتون, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wilt make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it unto تتراجراماتون. For Manoah knew not that he was the angel of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Manoah said unto the angel of تتراجراماتون, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون said unto him, Wherefore askest thou after my name, seeing it is wonderful? [T.N. See Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock unto تتراجراماتون: and the angel did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of تتراجراماتون ascended in the flame of the altar: and Manoah and his wife looked on; and they fell on their faces to the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But the angel of تتراجراماتون did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife.
<br>
 Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But his wife said unto him, If تتراجراماتون were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things as these.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and تتراجراماتون blessed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And the Spirit of تتراجراماتون began to move him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
