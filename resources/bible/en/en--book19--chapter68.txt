<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; A Psalm of Dawad, a song) Let Elokim arise, let his enemies be scattered;
<br>
Let them also that hate him flee before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> As smoke is driven away, so drive them away:
<br>
As wax melteth before the fire,
<br>
So let the wicked perish at the presence of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But let the righteous be glad; let them exult before Elokim:
<br>
Yea, let them rejoice with gladness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Sing unto Elokim, sing praises to his name:
<br>
Cast up a highway for him that rideth through the deserts;
<br>
His name is تتراجراماتون; and exult ye before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows,
<br>
Is Elokim in his holy habitation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Elokim setteth the solitary in families:
<br>
He bringeth out the prisoners into prosperity;
<br>
But the rebellious dwell in a parched land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> O Elokim, when thou wentest forth before thy people,
<br>
When thou didst march through the wilderness;
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The earth trembled,
<br>
The heavens also dropped rain at the presence of Elokim:
<br>
Yon Sinai trembled at the presence of Elokim, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thou, O Elokim, didst send a plentiful rain,
<br>
Thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thy congregation dwelt therein:
<br>
Thou, O Elokim, didst prepare of thy goodness for the poor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> HaAdon giveth the word:
<br>
The women that publish the tidings are a great host.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Kings of armies flee, they flee;
<br>
And she that tarrieth at home divideth the spoil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> When ye lie among the sheepfolds,
<br>
It is as the wings of a dove covered with silver,
<br>
And her pinions with yellow gold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> When the Almighty scattered kings therein,
<br>
It was as when it snoweth in Zalmon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> A mountain of Elokim is the mountain of Bashan;
<br>
A high mountain is the mountain of Bashan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Why look ye askance, ye high mountains,
<br>
At the mountain which Elokim hath desired for his abode?
<br>
Yea, تتراجراماتون will dwell in it for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The chariots of Elokim are twenty thousand, even thousands upon thousands:
<br>
HaAdon is among them, as in Sinai, in the sanctuary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led away captives;
<br>
Thou hast received gifts among men,
<br>
Yea, among the rebellious also, that تتراجراماتون Elokim might dwell with them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Blessed be HaAdon, who daily beareth our burden,
<br>
Even the Elokim who is our salvation.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Elokim is unto us a Elokim of deliverances;
<br>
And unto تتراجراماتون HaAdon belongeth escape from death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But Elokim will smite through the head of his enemies,
<br>
The hairy scalp of such a one as goeth on still in his guiltiness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> HaAdon said, I will bring again from Bashan,
<br>
I will bring them again from the depths of the sea;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> That thou mayest crush them, dipping thy foot in blood,
<br>
That the tongue of thy dogs may have its portion from thine enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> They have seen thy goings, O Elokim,
<br>
Even the goings of my Elokim, my King, into the sanctuary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,
<br>
In the midst of the damsels playing with timbrels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Bless ye Elokim in the congregations,
<br>
Even HaAdon, ye that are of the fountain of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> There is little Benjamin their ruler,
<br>
The princes of Judah and their council,
<br>
The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphtali.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Thy Elokim hath commanded thy strength:
<br>
Strengthen, O Elokim, that which thou hast wrought for us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Because of thy temple at Jerusalem
<br>
Kings shall bring presents unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds,
<br>
The multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the peoples,
<br>
Trampling under foot the pieces of silver:
<br>
He hath scattered the peoples that delight in war.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Princes shall come out of Egypt;
<br>
Ethiopia shall haste to stretch out her hands unto Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Sing unto Elokim, ye kingdoms of the earth;
<br>
Oh sing praises unto HaAdon;
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> To him that rideth upon the heaven of heavens, which are of old;
<br>
Lo, he uttereth his voice, a mighty voice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Ascribe ye strength unto Elokim:
<br>
His excellency is over Israel,
<br>
And his strength is in the skies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> O Elokim, thou art terrible out of thy holy places:
<br>
The Elokim of Israel, he giveth strength and power unto his people.
<br>
Blessed be Elokim.
