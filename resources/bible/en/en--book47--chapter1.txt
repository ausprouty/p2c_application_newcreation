<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, an apostle of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]through the will of Elokim, and Timothy our brother, unto the New Creation Masjid of Elokim which is at Corinth, with all the saints that are in the whole of Achaia:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Grace to you and peace from Elokim our Father and HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Blessed be the Elokim and Father of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], the Father of mercies and Elokim of all comfort; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> who comforteth us in all our affliction, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any affliction, through the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For as the sufferings of Al-Masih abound unto us, even so our comfort also aboundeth through Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which worketh in the patient enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and our hope for you is stedfast; knowing that, as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so also are ye of the comfort.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> yea, we ourselves have had the sentence of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in Elokim who raiseth the dead: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver: on whom we have set our hope that he will also still deliver us; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> ye also helping together on our behalf by your supplication; that, for the gift bestowed upon us by means of many, thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in holiness and sincerity of Elokim, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of Elokim, we behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For we write no other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge, and I hope ye will acknowledge unto the end: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> as also ye did acknowledge us in part, that we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And in this confidence I was minded to come first unto you, that ye might have a second benefit; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and by you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judaea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But as Elokim is faithful, our word toward you is not yea and nay.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For the Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] of Elokim, [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him is yea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For how many soever be the promises of Elokim, in him is the yea: wherefore also through him is the Amen, unto the glory of Elokim through us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Now he that establisheth us with you in Al-Masih, and anointed us, is Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> who also sealed us, and gave us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But I call Elokim for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I forbare to come unto Corinth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for in faith ye stand fast.
