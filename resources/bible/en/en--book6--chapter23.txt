<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass after many days, when تتراجراماتون had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well stricken in years;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for their heads, and for their judges and for their officers, and said unto them, I am old and well stricken in years: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and ye have seen all that تتراجراماتون your Elokim hath done unto all these nations because of you; for تتراجراماتون your Elokim, he it is that hath fought for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Behold, I have allotted unto you these nations that remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And تتراجراماتون your Elokim, he will thrust them out from before you, and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess their land, as تتراجراماتون your Elokim spoke unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Therefore be ye very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Musa, that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> that ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their Elokim, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow down yourselves unto them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> but cleave unto تتراجراماتون your Elokim, as ye have done unto this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For تتراجراماتون hath driven out from before you great nations and strong: but as for you, no man hath stood before you unto this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> One man of you shall chase a thousand; for تتراجراماتون your Elokim, he it is that fighteth for you, as he spoke unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Else if ye do at all go back, and cleave unto the remnant of these nations, even these that remain among you, and make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to you; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> know for a certainty that تتراجراماتون your Elokim will no more drive these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be a snare and a trap unto you, and a scourge in your sides, and thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land which تتراجراماتون your Elokim hath given you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which تتراجراماتون your Elokim spoke concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, not one thing hath failed thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon you of which تتراجراماتون your Elokim spoke unto you, so will تتراجراماتون bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which تتراجراماتون your Elokim hath given you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> When ye transgress the covenant of تتراجراماتون your Elokim, which he commanded you, and go and serve other Elokim, and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of تتراجراماتون be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you.
