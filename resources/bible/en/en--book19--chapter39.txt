<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician, for Jeduthun. A Psalm of Dawad) I said, I will take heed to my ways,
<br>
That I sin not with my tongue:
<br>
I will keep my mouth with a bridle,
<br>
While the wicked is before me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good;
<br>
And my sorrow was stirred.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> My heart was hot within me;
<br>
While I was musing the fire burned;
<br>
Then spoke I with my tongue:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> تتراجراماتون, make me to know mine end,
<br>
And the measure of my days, what it is;
<br>
Let me know how frail I am.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Behold, thou hast made my days as handbreadths;
<br>
And my life-time is as nothing before thee:
<br>
Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Surely every man walketh in a vain show;
<br>
Surely they are disquieted in vain:
<br>
He heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And now, Lord, what wait I for?
<br>
My hope is in thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Deliver me from all my transgressions:
<br>
Make me not the reproach of the foolish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I was dumb, I opened not my mouth;
<br>
Because thou didst it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Remove thy stroke away from me:
<br>
I am consumed by the blow of thy hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity,
<br>
Thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth:
<br>
Surely every man is vanity.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Hear my prayer, O تتراجراماتون, and give ear unto my cry;
<br>
Hold not thy peace at my tears:
<br>
For I am a stranger with thee,
<br>
A sojourner, as all my fathers were.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Oh spare me, that I may recover strength,
<br>
Before I go hence, and be no more.
