<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now in the things which we are saying the chief point is this: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> a minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which HaAdon pitched, not man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that this high priest also have somewhat to offer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are those who offer the gifts according to the law; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> who serve that which is a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Musa is warned of Elokim when he is about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But now hath he obtained a ministry the more excellent, by so much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which hath been enacted upon better promises.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For if that first covenant had been faultless, then would no place have been sought for a second.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For finding fault with them, he saith,
<br>
Behold, the days come, saith HaAdon,
<br>
That I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
<br>
In the day that I took them by the hand to lead them forth out of the land of Egypt;
<br>
For they continued not in my covenant,
<br>
And I regarded them not, saith HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
<br>
After those days, saith HaAdon;
<br>
I will put my laws into their mind,
<br>
And on their heart also will I write them:
<br>
And I will be to them a Elokim,
<br>
And they shall be to me a people:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen,
<br>
And every man his brother, saying, Know HaAdon:
<br>
For all shall know me,
<br>
From the least to the greatest of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For I will be merciful to their iniquities,
<br>
And their sins will I remember no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.
<br>
 But that which is becoming old and waxeth aged is nigh unto vanishing away.
