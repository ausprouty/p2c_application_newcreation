<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The word of تتراجراماتون that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, or in the days of your fathers? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; and that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpillar eaten.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and wail, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig-tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The meal-offering and the drink-offering are cut off from the house of تتراجراماتون; the priests, تتراجراماتون’s ministers, mourn.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The field is laid waste, the land mourneth; for the grain is destroyed, the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Be confounded, O ye husbandmen, wail, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; for the harvest of the field is perished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The vine is withered, and the fig-tree languisheth; the pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field are withered: for joy is withered away from the sons of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Gird yourselves with sackcloth, and lament, ye priests; wail, ye ministers of the altar; come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my Elokim: for the meal-offering and the drink-offering are withholden from the house of your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the old men and all the inhabitants of the land unto the house of تتراجراماتون your Elokim, and cry unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Alas for the day! for the day of تتراجراماتون is at hand, and as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Is not the food cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our Elokim? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The seeds rot under their clods; the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the grain is withered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> O تتراجراماتون, to thee do I cry; for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto thee; for the water brooks are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.
