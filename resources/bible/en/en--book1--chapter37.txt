<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) dwelt in the land of his father’s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> These are the generations of Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
 Yusuf (Joseph), being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and Yusuf (Joseph) brought the evil report of them unto their father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Now Israel loved Yusuf (Joseph) more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren; and they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> for, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves came round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed yet a dream; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he told it to his father, and to his brethren; and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the saying in mind.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in Shechem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Israel said unto Yusuf (Joseph), Are not thy brethren feeding the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them.
<br>
 And he said to him, Here am I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he said to him, Go now, see whether it is well with thy brethren, and well with the flock; and bring me word again.
<br>
 So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he said, I am seeking my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they are feeding the flock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Yusuf (Joseph) went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And they saw him afar off, and before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into one of the pits, and we will say, An evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said, Let us not take his life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood; cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him: that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And it came to pass, when Yusuf (Joseph) was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Yusuf (Joseph) of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and they took him, and cast him into the pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother, our flesh. And his brethren hearkened unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And there passed by Midianites, merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Yusuf (Joseph) out of the pit, and sold Yusuf (Joseph) to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver.
<br>
 And they brought Yusuf (Joseph) into Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Yusuf (Joseph) was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And they took Yusuf’s coat, and killed a he-goat, and dipped the coat in the blood; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> and they sent the coat of many colors, and they brought it to their father, and said, This have we found: know now whether it is thy son’s coat or not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat: an evil beast hath devoured him; Yusuf (Joseph) is without doubt torn in pieces.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down to Sheol to my son mourning.
<br>
 And his father wept for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard.
