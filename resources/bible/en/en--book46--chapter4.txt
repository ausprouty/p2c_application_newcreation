<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Let a man so account of us, as of ministers of al-Masih, and stewards of the mysteries of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Here, moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man’s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Wherefore judge nothing before the time, until HaAdon come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each man have his praise from Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Now these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos for your sakes; that in us ye might learn not to go beyond the things which are written; that no one of you be puffed up for the one against the other.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For who maketh thee to differ? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Already are ye filled, already ye are become rich, ye have come to reign without us: yea and I would that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For, I think, Elokim hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as men doomed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, both to angels and men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> We are fools for al-Masih’s sake, but ye are wise in al-Masih; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye have glory, but we have dishonor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and we toil, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, even until now.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I write not these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For though ye have ten thousand tutors in al-Masih, yet have ye not many fathers; for in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]I begat you through the Holy Injil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I beseech you therefore, be ye imitators of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, who is my beloved and faithful child in HaAdon, who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which are in al-Masih, even as I teach everywhere in every New Creation Masjid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Now some are puffed up, as though I were not coming to you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But I will come to you shortly, if HaAdon will; and I will know, not the word of them that are puffed up, but the power.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For the kingdom of Elokim is not in word, but in power.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?
