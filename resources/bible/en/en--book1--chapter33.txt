<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming, and with him four hundred men.
<br>
 And he divided the children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two handmaids.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Yusuf (Joseph) hindermost.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he himself passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The children whom Elokim hath graciously given thy servant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Then the handmaids came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Yusuf (Joseph) near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he said, What meanest thou by all this company which I met? And he said, To find favor in the sight of my lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; let that which thou hast be thine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found favor in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand; forasmuch as I have seen thy face, as one seeth the face of Elokim, and thou wast pleased with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Take, I pray thee, my gift that is brought to thee; because Elokim hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough.
<br>
 And he urged him, and he took it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are tender, and that the flocks and herds with me have their young: and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on gently, according to the pace of the cattle that are before me and according to the pace of the children, until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me.
<br>
 And he said, What needeth it? let me find favor in the sight of my lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) journeyed to Succoth, and built him a house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan-aram; and encamped before the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] the parcel of ground, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he erected there an altar, and called it El-Elohe-Israel.
