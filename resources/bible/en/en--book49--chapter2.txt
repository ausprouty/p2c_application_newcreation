<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And you did he make alive, when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins [T.N. See 2 Kings 5:14 the leper Naaman who is as good as dead, cut off from much of life by leprosy.  Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that God can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (Romans 6:3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19

أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .]
<br>
, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:’ 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> but Elokim, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Al-Masih (by grace have ye been saved), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> not of works, that no man should glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For we are his workmanship, created in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]for good works, which Elokim afore prepared that we should walk in them. [T.N. This summarizes the urgency of Isaiah 53:11 which says of al-Masih, He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of him (see John 14:9) shall my righteous servant justify many (see Romans 5:1; Genesis 15:6; Habakkuk 2:4; Romans 3:28; Galatians 3:24. No al-Salaam peace with تتراجراماتون without faith in Masih and depending on him alone to be put right with تتراجراماتون; and, yes, true faith is active in love, Galatians 5:6; James 2:14, 17, 20, 26; <sup class="versenum">10). We see from Exodus 12:13 the token in that verse that points to Isaiah 53:7 and John 14:6 and constitutes the token of justification (Romans 5:9) and admission to heaven.]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> that ye were at that time separate from Al-Masih, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without Elokim in the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But now in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, so making peace; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and might reconcile them both in one body unto Elokim through the Tree, having slain the enmity thereby: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of Elokim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]himself being the chief corner stone; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in HaAdon; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of Elokim in the Spirit.
