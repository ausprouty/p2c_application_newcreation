<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I know a man in Al-Masih, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; Elokim knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; Elokim knoweth), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in my weaknesses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me to be, or heareth from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Concerning this thing I besought HaAdon thrice, that it might depart from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect in weakness.
<br>
 Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Al-Masih may rest upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for al-Masihâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the New Creation Masjid, except it be that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls.
<br>
 If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him.
<br>
 Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of Elokim speak we in Al-Masih. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means there should be strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> lest again when I come my Elokim should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.
