<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Let not your heart be troubled: believe in Elokim, believe also in me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> In my Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I come again, and will receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And whither I go, ye know the way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; how know we the way? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto him, I am the way, and the truth, and the life: no one cometh unto the Father, but by me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> If ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also: from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Philip saith unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and dost thou not know me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; how sayest thou, Show us the Father? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I say unto you I speak not from myself: but the Father abiding in me doeth his works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> If ye shall ask anything in my name, that will I do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> If ye love me, ye will keep my commandments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may be with you for ever, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> even the Spirit of truth: whom the world cannot receive; for it beholdeth him not, neither knoweth him: ye know him; for he abideth with you, and shall be in you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I will not leave you desolate: I come unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Yet a little while, and the world beholdeth me no more; but ye behold me: because I live, ye shall live also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> In that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Judas (not Iscariot) saith unto him, Lord, what is come to pass that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my word: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> He that loveth me not keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father’s who sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> These things have I spoken unto you, while yet abiding with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> But the Comforter, even the Holy Ruach, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I said unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
<br>
 Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be fearful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Ye heard how I said to you, I go away, and I come unto you.
<br>
 If ye loved me, ye would have rejoiced, because I go unto the Father: for the Father is greater than I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> I will no more speak much with you, for the prince of the world cometh: and he hath nothing in me; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> but that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.
<br>
 Arise, let us go hence.
