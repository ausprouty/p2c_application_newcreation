<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then Yunus (Jonah) prayed unto تتراجراماتون his Elokim out of the fish’s belly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he said,
<br>
I called by reason of mine affliction unto تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And he answered me;
<br>
Out of the belly of Sheol cried I,
<br>
And thou heardest my voice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas,
<br>
And the flood was round about me;
<br>
All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes;
<br>
Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The waters compassed me about, even to the soul;
<br>
The deep was round about me;
<br>
The weeds were wrapped about my head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;
<br>
The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever:
<br>
Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O تتراجراماتون my Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> When my soul fainted within me, I remembered تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> They that regard lying vanities
<br>
Forsake their own mercy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
<br>
I will pay that which I have vowed.
<br>
Salvation is of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Yunus (Jonah) upon the dry land.
