<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of Elokim, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to Elokim, which is your spiritual service.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And be not fashioned according to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but so to think as to think soberly, according as Elokim hath dealt to each man a measure of faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members have not the same office: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> so we, who are many, are one body in Al-Masih, and severally members one of another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> or ministry, let us give ourselves to our ministry; or he that teacheth, to his teaching; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> or he that exhorteth, to his exhorting: he that giveth, let him do it with liberality; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Let love be without hypocrisy.
<br>
 Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned one to another; in honor preferring one another; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> in diligence not slothful; fervent in spirit; serving HaAdon; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing stedfastly in prayer; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> communicating to the necessities of the saints; given to hospitality.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Bless them that persecute you; bless, and curse not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Rejoice with them that rejoice; weep with them that weep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Be of the same mind one toward another.
<br>
 Set not your mind on high things, but condescend to things that are lowly.
<br>
 Be not wise in your own conceits.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Render to no man evil for evil.
<br>
 Take thought for things honorable in the sight of all men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> If it be possible, as much as in you lieth, be at peace with all men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Avenge not yourselves, beloved, but give place unto the wrath of Elokim: for it is written, Vengeance belongeth unto me; I will recompense, saith HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him to drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
