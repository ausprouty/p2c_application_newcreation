<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook?
<br>
Or press down his tongue with a cord?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Canst thou put a rope into his nose?
<br>
Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Will he make many supplications unto thee?
<br>
Or will he speak soft words unto thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Will he make a covenant with thee,
<br>
That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?
<br>
Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Will the bands of fishermen make traffic of him?
<br>
Will they part him among the merchants?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons,
<br>
Or his head with fish-spears?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Lay thy hand upon him;
<br>
Remember the battle, and do so no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Behold, the hope of him is in vain:
<br>
Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> None is so fierce that he dare stir him up;
<br>
Who then is he that can stand before me?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him?
<br>
Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I will not keep silence concerning his limbs,
<br>
Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Who can strip off his outer garment?
<br>
Who shall come within his jaws?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Who can open the doors of his face?
<br>
Round about his teeth is terror.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> His strong scales are his pride,
<br>
Shut up together as with a close seal.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> One is so near to another,
<br>
That no air can come between them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> They are joined one to another;
<br>
They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> His sneezings flash forth light,
<br>
And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Out of his mouth go burning torches,
<br>
And sparks of fire leap forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth,
<br>
As of a boiling pot and burning rushes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> His breath kindleth coals,
<br>
And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> In his neck abideth strength,
<br>
And terror danceth before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The flakes of his flesh are joined together:
<br>
They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> His heart is as firm as a stone;
<br>
Yea, firm as the nether millstone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid:
<br>
By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail;
<br>
Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> He counteth iron as straw,
<br>
And brass as rotten wood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> The arrow cannot make him flee:
<br>
Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Clubs are counted as stubble:
<br>
He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> His underparts are like sharp potsherds:
<br>
He spreadeth as it were a threshing-wain upon the mire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:
<br>
He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> He maketh a path to shine after him;
<br>
One would think the deep to be hoary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Upon earth there is not his like,
<br>
That is made without fear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> He beholdeth everything that is high:
<br>
He is king over all the sons of pride.
