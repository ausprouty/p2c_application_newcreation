<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then sang Musa and the children of Israel this song unto تتراجراماتون, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto تتراجراماتون, for he hath triumphed gloriously: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> تتراجراماتون is my strength and song, And he is become my salvation: This is my Elokim, and I will praise him; My father’s Elokim, and I will exalt him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> تتراجراماتون is a man of war:
<br>
تتراجراماتون is his name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea;
<br>
And his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The deeps cover them: They went down into the depths like a stone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thy right hand, O تتراجراماتون, is glorious in power,
<br>
Thy right hand, O تتراجراماتون, dasheth in pieces the enemy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And in the greatness of thine excellency thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: Thou sendest forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were piled up,
<br>
The floods stood upright as a heap;
<br>
The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;
<br>
My desire shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Who is like unto thee, O تتراجراماتون, among the Elokim? Who is like thee, glorious in holiness,
<br>
Fearful in praises, doing wonders?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, The earth swallowed them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people that thou hast redeemed: Thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The peoples have heard, they tremble:
<br>
Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then were the chiefs of Edom dismayed; The mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold upon them: All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Terror and dread falleth upon them; By the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; Till thy people pass over, O تتراجراماتون, Till the people pass over that thou hast purchased [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Thou wilt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, The place, O تتراجراماتون, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, The sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> تتراجراماتون shall reign for ever and ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and تتراجراماتون brought back the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Haron (Aaron), took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And Miriam answered them,
<br>
Sing ye to تتراجراماتون, for he hath triumphed gloriously;
<br>
The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Musa led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And the people murmured against Musa, saying, What shall we drink? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> An he cried unto تتراجراماتون; And تتراجراماتون showed him a tree, and he cast it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, and wilt do that which is right in his eyes, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases upon thee, which I have put upon the Egyptians: for I am تتراجراماتون that healeth thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And they came to Elim, where were twelve springs of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters.
