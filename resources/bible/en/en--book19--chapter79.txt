<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Psalm of Asaph) O Elokim, the nations are come into thine inheritance;
<br>
Thy holy temple have they defiled;
<br>
They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens,
<br>
The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
<br>
And there was none to bury them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> We are become a reproach to our neighbors,
<br>
A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> How long, O تتراجراماتون? wilt thou be angry for ever?
<br>
Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not,
<br>
And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For they have devoured Ya’qub (Jacob),
<br>
And laid waste his habitation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers:
<br>
Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us;
<br>
For we are brought very low.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Help us, O Elokim of our salvation, for the glory of thy name;
<br>
And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name’s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their Elokim?
<br>
Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed
<br>
Be known among the nations in our sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee:
<br>
According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom
<br>
Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture
<br>
Will give thee thanks for ever:
<br>
We will show forth thy praise to all generations.
