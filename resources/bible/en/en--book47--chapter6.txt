<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And working together with him we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of Elokim in vain
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> (for he saith,
<br>
At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee,
<br>
And in a day of salvation did I succor thee:
<br>
behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation): 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of Elokim, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Ruach, in love unfeigned, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> in the word of truth, in the power of Elokim; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And what concord hath Al-Masih with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And what agreement hath a temple of Elokim with idols? for we are a temple of the living Elokim; even as Elokim said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their Elokim, and they shall be my people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Wherefore
<br>
Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate,
<br>
saith HaAdon,
<br>
And touch no unclean thing;
<br>
And I will receive you,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And will be to you a Father,
<br>
And ye shall be to me sons and daughters,
<br>
saith HaAdon Almighty.
