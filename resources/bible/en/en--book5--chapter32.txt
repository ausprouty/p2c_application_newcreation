<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak;
<br>
And let the earth hear the words of my mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> My doctrine shall drop as the rain;
<br>
My speech shall distil as the dew,
<br>
As the small rain upon the tender grass,
<br>
And as the showers upon the herb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For I will proclaim the name of تتراجراماتون:
<br>
Ascribe ye greatness unto our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The Rock, his work is perfect;
<br>
For all his ways are justice:
<br>
A Elokim of faithfulness and without iniquity,
<br>
Just and right is he.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They have dealt corruptly with him, they are not his children, it is their blemish;
<br>
They are a perverse and crooked generation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Do ye thus requite تتراجراماتون, O foolish people and unwise?
<br>
Is not he thy father that hath bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] thee? He hath made thee, and established thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Remember the days of old,
<br>
Consider the years of many generations:
<br>
Ask thy father, and he will show thee;
<br>
Thine elders, and they will tell thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,
<br>
When he separated the children of men,
<br>
He set the bounds of the peoples
<br>
According to the number of the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For تتراجراماتون’s portion is his people;
<br>
Ya’qub (Jacob) is the lot of his inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He found him in a desert land,
<br>
And in the waste howling wilderness;
<br>
He compassed him about, he cared for him,
<br>
He kept him as the apple of his eye.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> As an eagle that stirreth up her nest,
<br>
That fluttereth over her young,
<br>
He spread abroad his wings, he took them,
<br>
He bare them on his pinions.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> تتراجراماتون alone did lead him,
<br>
And there was no foreign Elokim with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He made him ride on the high places of the earth,
<br>
And he did eat the increase of the field;
<br>
And he made him to suck honey out of the rock,
<br>
And oil out of the flinty rock;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock,
<br>
With fat of lambs,
<br>
And rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats,
<br>
With the finest of the wheat;
<br>
And of the blood of the grape thou drankest wine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked:
<br>
Thou art waxed fat, thou art grown thick, thou art become sleek;
<br>
Then he forsook Elokim who made him,
<br>
And lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> They moved him to jealousy with strange Elokim;
<br>
With abominations provoked they him to anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> They sacrificed unto demons, which were no Elokim,
<br>
To Elokim that they knew not,
<br>
To new Elokim that came up of late,
<br>
Which your fathers dreaded not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful,
<br>
And hast forgotten Elokim that gave thee birth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And تتراجراماتون saw it, and abhorred them,
<br>
Because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he said, I will hide my face from them,
<br>
I will see what their end shall be:
<br>
For they are a very perverse generation,
<br>
Children in whom is no faithfulness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not Elokim;
<br>
They have provoked me to anger with their vanities:
<br>
And I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a people;
<br>
I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For a fire is kindled in mine anger,
<br>
And burneth unto the lowest Sheol,
<br>
And devoureth the earth with its increase,
<br>
And setteth on fire the foundations of the mountains.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> I will heap evils upon them;
<br>
I will spend mine arrows upon them:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> They shall be wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat
<br>
And bitter destruction;
<br>
And the teeth of beasts will I send upon them,
<br>
With the poison of crawling things of the dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Without shall the sword bereave,
<br>
And in the chambers terror;
<br>
It shall destroy both young man and virgin,
<br>
The suckling with the man of gray hairs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> I said, I would scatter them afar,
<br>
I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,
<br>
Lest their adversaries should judge amiss,
<br>
Lest they should say, Our hand is exalted,
<br>
And تتراجراماتون hath not done all this.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> For they are a nation void of counsel,
<br>
And there is no understanding in them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Oh that they were wise, that they understood this,
<br>
That they would consider their latter end!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> How should one chase a thousand,
<br>
And two put ten thousand to flight,
<br>
Except their Rock had sold them,
<br>
And تتراجراماتون had delivered them up?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> For their rock is not as our Rock,
<br>
Even our enemies themselves being judges.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom,
<br>
And of the fields of Gomorrah:
<br>
Their grapes are grapes of gall,
<br>
Their clusters are bitter:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Their wine is the poison of serpents,
<br>
And the cruel venom of asps.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Is not this laid up in store with me,
<br>
Sealed up among my treasures?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Vengeance is mine, and recompense,
<br>
At the time when their foot shall slide:
<br>
For the day of their calamity is at hand,
<br>
And the things that are to come upon them shall make haste.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> For تتراجراماتون will judge his people,
<br>
And repent himself for his servants;
<br>
When he seeth that their power is gone,
<br>
And there is none remaining, shut up or left at large.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And he will say, Where are their Elokim,
<br>
The rock in which they took refuge;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices,
<br>
And drank the wine of their drink-offering?
<br>
Let them rise up and help you,
<br>
Let them be your protection.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> See now that I, even I, am he,
<br>
And there is no Elokim with me:
<br>
I kill, and I make alive;
<br>
I wound, and I heal;
<br>
And there is none that can deliver out of my hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> For I lift up my hand to heaven,
<br>
And say, As I live for ever,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> If I whet my glittering sword,
<br>
And my hand take hold on judgment;
<br>
I will render vengeance to mine adversaries,
<br>
And will recompense them that hate me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> I will make mine arrows drunk with blood,
<br>
And my sword shall devour flesh;
<br>
With the blood of the slain and the captives,
<br>
From the head of the leaders of the enemy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people:
<br>
For he will avenge the blood of his servants,
<br>
And will render vengeance to his adversaries,
<br>
And will make expiation for his land, for his people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And Musa came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And Musa made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> and he said unto them, Set your heart unto all the words which I testify unto you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, even all the words of this law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over the Jordan to possess it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa that selfsame day, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> Get thee up into this mountain of Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people, as Haron (Aaron) thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:<sup class="versenum">51</sup> because ye trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> For thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither into the land which I give the children of Israel.
