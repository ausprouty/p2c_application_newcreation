<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In the third month after the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And when they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Musa went up unto Elokim, and تتراجراماتون called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Ya’qub (Jacob), and tell the children of Israel:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto myself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be mine own possession from among all peoples: for all the earth is mine: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.
<br>
 These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Musa came and called for the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which تتراجراماتون commanded him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And all the people answered together, and said, All that تتراجراماتون hath spoken we will do.
<br>
 And Musa reported the words of the people unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe thee for ever. And Musa told the words of the people unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their garments, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and be ready against the third day; for the third day تتراجراماتون will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> no hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, he shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Musa went down from the mount unto the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their garments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day: come not near a woman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp trembled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Musa brought forth the people out of the camp to meet Elokim; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because تتراجراماتون descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Musa spoke, and Elokim answered him by a voice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And تتراجراماتون came down upon mount Sinai, to the top of the mount: and تتراجراماتون called Musa to the top of the mount; and Musa went up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through unto تتراجراماتون to gaze, and many of them perish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And let the priests also, that come near to تتراجراماتون, sanctify themselves, lest تتراجراماتون break forth upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Musa said unto تتراجراماتون, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou didst charge us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto him, Go, get thee down; and thou shalt come up, thou, and Haron (Aaron) with thee: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto تتراجراماتون, lest he break forth upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> So Musa went down unto the people, and told them.
