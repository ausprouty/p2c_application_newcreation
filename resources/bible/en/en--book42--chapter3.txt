<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> in the highpriesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of Elokim came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he came into all the region round about the Jordan, preaching the total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3) of repentance unto remission of sins; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet,
<br>
The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
<br>
Make ye ready the way of HaAdon,
<br>
Make his paths straight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Every valley shall be filled,
<br>
And every mountain and hill shall be brought low;
<br>
And the crooked shall become straight,
<br>
And the rough ways smooth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And all flesh shall see the salvation of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He said therefore to the multitudes that went out to be given a total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3)  of him, Ye offspring of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Ibrahim (Abraham) to our father: for I say unto you, that Elokim is able of these stones to raise up children unto Ibrahim (Abraham).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And even now the axe also lieth at the root of the trees: every tree therefore that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the multitudes asked him, saying, What then must we do? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he answered and said unto them, He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none; and he that hath food, let him do likewise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And there came also publicans to be given a total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3) , and they said unto him, Teacher, what must we do? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he said unto them, Extort no more than that which is appointed you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And soldiers also asked him, saying, And we, what must we do? And he said unto them, Extort from no man by violence, neither accuse any one wrongfully; and be content with your wages.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And as the people were in expectation, and all men reasoned in their hearts concerning John, whether by any chance he were al-Masih; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you with water; but there cometh he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose: he shall baptize you in the Holy Ruach and in fire: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> whose fan is in his hand, thoroughly to cleanse his threshing-floor, and to gather the wheat into his garner; but the chaff he will burn up with unquenchable fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> With many other exhortations therefore preached he good tidings unto the people; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> but Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother’s wife, and for all the evil things which Herod had done, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> added this also to them all, that he shut up John in prison.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Now it came to pass, when all the people were given a baptism , that, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]also having been given a baptism , and praying, the heaven was opened, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> and the Holy Ruach descended in a bodily form, as a dove, upon him, and a voice came out of heaven, Thou art my beloved Son [T.N.Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15).
