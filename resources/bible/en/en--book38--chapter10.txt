<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Ask ye of تتراجراماتون rain in the time of the latter rain, even of تتراجراماتون that maketh lightnings; and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie; and they have told false dreams, they comfort in vain: therefore they go their way like sheep, they are afflicted, because there is no shepherd.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for تتراجراماتون of hosts hath visited his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them as his goodly horse in the battle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And they shall be as mighty men, treading down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, because تتراجراماتون is with them; and the riders on horses shall be confounded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Yusuf (Joseph), and I will bring them back; for I have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am تتراجراماتون their Elokim, and I will hear them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine; yea, their children shall see it, and rejoice; their heart shall be glad in تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them; and they shall increase as they have increased.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And I will sow them among the peoples; and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children, and shall return.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he will pass through the sea of affliction, and will smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And I will strengthen them in تتراجراماتون; and they shall walk up and down in his name, saith تتراجراماتون.
