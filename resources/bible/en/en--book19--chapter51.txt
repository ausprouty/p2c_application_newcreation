<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Dawad; when Nathan the prophet came unto him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba) Have mercy upon me, O Elokim, according to thy lovingkindness:
<br>
According to the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,
<br>
And cleanse me from my sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For I know my transgressions;
<br>
And my sin is ever before me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Against thee, thee only, have I sinned,
<br>
And done that which is evil in thy sight;
<br>
That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest,
<br>
And be clear when thou judgest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity; And in sin did my mother conceive me [T.N. In other words, Dawad (David) says he was a sinner from conception. See Psalm 58:3; Job 14:4.  He refers here to hereditary corruption which necessitates the new creation new birth (John 3:3) known by all true Khalq Jadeed submitters to تتراجراماتو and because of the life of the persecutor Saul in Acts 9:1-19 being the foremost example. See 2 Kings 5:14 where it says that then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that تتراجراماتو  can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (Romans 6:3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts;
<br>
And in the hidden part thou wilt make me to know wisdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean:
<br>
Wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Make me to hear joy and gladness,
<br>
That the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Hide thy face from my sins,
<br>
And blot out all mine iniquities.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Create in me a clean heart, O Elokim;
<br>
And renew a right spirit within me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Cast me not away from thy presence;
<br>
And take not thy Holy Ruach from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation;
<br>
And uphold me with a willing spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then will I teach transgressors thy ways;
<br>
And sinners shall be converted unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O Elokim, thou Elokim of my salvation; And my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> O Lord, open thou my lips;
<br>
And my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For thou delightest not in sacrifice; else would I give it:
<br>
Thou hast no pleasure in burnt-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The sacrifices of Elokim are a broken spirit:
<br>
A broken and a contrite heart, O Elokim, thou wilt not despise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion:
<br>
Build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Then wilt thou delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
<br>
In burnt-offering and whole burnt-offering:
<br>
Then will they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
