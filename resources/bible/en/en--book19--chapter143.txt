<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Psalm of Dawad) Hear my prayer, O تتراجراماتون; give ear to my supplications:
<br>
In thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And enter not into judgment with thy servant;
<br>
For in thy sight no man living is righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For the enemy hath persecuted my soul;
<br>
He hath smitten my life down to the ground:
<br>
He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me;
<br>
My heart within me is desolate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I remember the days of old;
<br>
I meditate on all thy doings;
<br>
I muse on the work of thy hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I spread forth my hands unto thee:
<br>
My soul thirsteth after thee, as a weary land.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Make haste to answer me, O تتراجراماتون; my spirit faileth:
<br>
Hide not thy face from me,
<br>
Lest I become like them that go down into the pit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning;
<br>
For in thee do I trust:
<br>
Cause me to know the way wherein I should walk;
<br>
For I lift up my soul unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Deliver me, O تتراجراماتون, from mine enemies:
<br>
I flee unto thee to hide me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Teach me to do thy will;
<br>
For thou art my Elokim:
<br>
Thy Spirit is good;
<br>
Lead me in the land of uprightness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Quicken me, O تتراجراماتون, for thy name’s sake:
<br>
In thy righteousness bring my soul out of trouble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And in thy lovingkindness cut off mine enemies,
<br>
And destroy all them that afflict my soul;
<br>
For I am thy servant.
