<sup class="versenum">1</sup> When therefore HaAdon knew that the Pharisees had heard that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was making and baptizing more disciples than John
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> (although [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]himself baptized not, but his disciples), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he must needs pass through Samaria.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Ya’qub (Jacob) gave to his son Yosef: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and Ya’qub’s well was there.
<br>
 [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well.
<br>
 It was about the sixth hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto her, Give me to drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of Elokim, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Art thou greater than our father Ya’qub (Jacob), who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband.
<br>
 [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Elokim is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called al-Mashi): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Come, see a man, who told me all things that ever I did: can this be al-Masih? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> They went out of the city, and were coming to him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that ever I did.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And many more believed because of his word; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> For [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine.
<br>
 And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> When he heard that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth.
<br>
 The man believed the word that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]spoke unto him, and he went his way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend.
<br>
 They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> So the father knew that it was at that hour in which [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> This is again the second sign that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.
