<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now I make known unto you brethren, the Holy Injil which I preached unto you, which also ye received, wherein also ye stand,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> by which also ye are saved, if ye hold fast the word which I preached unto you, except ye believed in vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For I delivered unto you first of all that which also I received: that Al-Masih died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and that he was buried; and that he hath been raised on the third day according to the scriptures; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and that he appeared to Cephas; then to the twelve; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> then he appeared to above five hundred brethren at once, of whom the greater part remain until now, but some are fallen asleep; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> then he appeared to James; then to all the apostles; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and last of all, as to the child untimely born, he appeared to me also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the New Creation Masjid of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But by the grace of Elokim I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not found vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of Elokim which was with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Whether then it be I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Now if Al-Masih is preached that he hath been raised from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither hath Al-Masih been raised: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and if Al-Masih hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Yea, and we are found false witnesses of Elokim; because we witnessed of Elokim that he raised up Al-Masih: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead are not raised.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For if the dead are not raised, neither hath Al-Masih been raised: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and if Al-Masih hath not been raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Then they also that are fallen asleep in Al-Masih have perished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> If we have only hoped in Al-Masih in this life, we are of all men most pitiable.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But now hath Al-Masih been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of them that are asleep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For as in Adam all die, so also in Al-Masih shall all be made alive.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But each in his own order: Al-Masih the firstfruits; then they that are al-Masihâ€™s, at his coming.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Then cometh the end, when he shall deliver up the kingdom to Elokim, even the Father; when he shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For he must reign, till he hath put all his enemies under his feet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> The last enemy that shall be abolished is death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For, He put all things in subjection under his feet.
<br>
 But when he saith, All things are put in subjection, it is evident that he is excepted who did subject all things unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And when all things have been subjected unto him, then shall the Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] also himself be subjected to him that did subject all things unto him, that Elokim may be all in all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Else what shall they do that are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then are they baptized for them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> I protest by that glorying in you, brethren, which I have in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]our Lord, I die daily.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Be not deceived: Evil companionships corrupt good morals.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Awake to soberness righteously, and sin not; for some have no knowledge of Elokim: I speak this to move you to shame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> But some one will say, How are the dead raised? and with what manner of body do they come? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Thou foolish one, that which thou thyself sowest is not quickened except it die: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but a bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other kind; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> but Elokim giveth it a body even as it pleased him, and to each seed a body of its own.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another flesh of birds, and another of fishes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differeth from another star in glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> So also is the resurrection of the dead.
<br>
 It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> it is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.
<br>
 If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> So also it is written, The first man Adam became a living soul.
<br>
 The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> Howbeit that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; then that which is spiritual.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is of heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of Elokim; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> Behold, I tell you a mystery: We all shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> But when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> The sting of death is sin; and the power of sin is the law<sup class="versenum"> 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> but thanks be to Elokim, who giveth us the victory through our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> Wherefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of HaAdon, forasmuch as ye know that your labor is not vain in HaAdon.
