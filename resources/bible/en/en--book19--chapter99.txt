<sup class="versenum">1</sup> تتراجراماتون reigneth; let the peoples tremble:
<br>
He sitteth above the cherubim; let the earth be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> تتراجراماتون is great in Zion;
<br>
And he is high above all the peoples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Let them praise thy great and terrible name:
<br>
Holy is he.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The king’s strength also loveth justice;
<br>
Thou dost establish equity;
<br>
Thou executest justice and righteousness in Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Exalt ye تتراجراماتون our Elokim,
<br>
And worship at his footstool:
<br>
Holy is he.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Musa and Haron (Aaron) among his priests,
<br>
And Samuel among them that call upon his name;
<br>
They called upon تتراجراماتون, and he answered them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He spoke unto them in the pillar of cloud:
<br>
They kept his testimonies,
<br>
And the statute that he gave them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Thou answeredst them, O تتراجراماتون our Elokim:
<br>
Thou wast a Elokim that forgavest them,
<br>
Though thou tookest vengeance of their doings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Exalt ye تتراجراماتون our Elokim,
<br>
And worship at his holy hill;
<br>
For تتراجراماتون our Elokim is holy.
