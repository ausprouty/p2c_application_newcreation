<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now Qarun (Korah), the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and they rose up before Musa, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and they assembled themselves together against Musa and against Haron (Aaron), and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and تتراجراماتون is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the assembly of تتراجراماتون?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And when Musa heard it, he fell upon his face: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and he spoke unto Qarun (Korah) and unto all his company, saying, In the morning تتراجراماتون will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he shall choose will he cause to come near unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> This do: take you censers, Qarun (Korah), and all his company; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and put fire in them, and put incense upon them before تتراجراماتون to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom تتراجراماتون doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Musa said unto Qarun (Korah), Hear now, ye sons of Levi: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the Elokim of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of تتراجراماتون, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them; :
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and that he hath brought thee near, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee? and seek ye the priesthood also? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Therefore thou and all thy company are gathered together against تتراجراماتون: and Haron (Aaron), what is he that ye murmur against him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Musa sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, We will not come up: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but thou must needs make thyself also a prince over us? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Musa was very wroth, and said unto تتراجراماتون, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And Musa said unto Qarun (Korah), Be thou and all thy company before تتراجراماتون, thou, and they, and Haron (Aaron), to-morrow: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and take ye every man his censer, and put incense upon them, and bring ye before تتراجراماتون every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Haron (Aaron), each his censer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent of meeting with Musa and Haron (Aaron).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Qarun (Korah) assembled all the congregation against them unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the glory of تتراجراماتون appeared unto all the congregation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa and unto Haron (Aaron), saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And they fell upon their faces, and said, O Elokim, the Elokim of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of Qarun (Korah), Dathan, and Abiram.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And Musa rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> So they gat them up from the tabernacle of Qarun (Korah), Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Musa said, Hereby ye shall know that تتراجراماتون hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then تتراجراماتون hath not sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> But if تتراجراماتون make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then ye shall understand that these men have despised تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And it came to pass, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men that appertained unto Qarun (Korah), and all their goods.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the assembly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them; for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And fire came forth from تتراجراماتون, and devoured the two hundred and fifty men that offered the incense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Speak unto Eleazar the son of Haron (Aaron) the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are holy, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before تتراجراماتون; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, which they that were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> to be a memorial unto the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, that is not of the seed of Haron (Aaron), come near to burn incense before تتراجراماتون; that he be not as Qarun (Korah), and as his company: as تتراجراماتون spoke unto him by Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Musa and against Haron (Aaron), saying, Ye have killed the people of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And it came to pass, when the congregation was assembled against Musa and against Haron (Aaron), that they looked toward the tent of meeting: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of تتراجراماتون appeared.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) came to the front of the tent of meeting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And Musa said unto Haron (Aaron), Take thy censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it quickly unto the congregation, and make atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from تتراجراماتون; the plague is begun.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And Haron (Aaron) took as Musa spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> Now they that died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Qarun (Korah).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And Haron (Aaron) returned unto Musa unto the door of the tent of meeting: and the plague was stayed.
