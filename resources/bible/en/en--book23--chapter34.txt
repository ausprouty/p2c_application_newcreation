<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples: let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof; the world, and all things that come forth from it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For تتراجراماتون hath indignation against all the nations, and wrath against all their host: he hath utterly destroyed them, he hath delivered them to the slaughter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Their slain also shall be cast out, and the stench of their dead bodies shall come up; and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fade away, as the leaf fadeth from off the vine, and as a fading leaf from the fig-tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For my sword hath drunk its fill in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The sword of تتراجراماتون is filled with blood, it is made fat with fatness, with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of the kidneys of rams; for تتراجراماتون hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the bulls: and their land shall be drunken with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For تتراجراماتون hath a day of vengeance, a year of recompense for the cause of Zion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the streams of Edom shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But the pelican and the porcupine shall possess it; and the owl and the raven shall dwell therein: and he will stretch over it the line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none shall be there; and all its princes shall be nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And thorns shall come up in its palaces, nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of jackals, a court for ostriches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the wild beasts of the desert shall meet with the wolves, and the wild goat shall cry to his fellow; yea, the night-monster shall settle there, and shall find her a place of rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> There shall the dart-snake make her nest, and lay, and hatch, and gather under her shade; yea, there shall the kites be gathered, every one with her mate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Seek ye out of the book of تتراجراماتون, and read: no one of these shall be missing, none shall want her mate; for my mouth, it hath commanded, and his Spirit, it hath gathered them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever; from generation to generation shall they dwell therein.
