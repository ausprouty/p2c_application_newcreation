<sup class="versenum">1</sup> But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> but when the fulness of the time came, Elokim sent forth his Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], born of a woman, born under the law, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And because ye are sons, Elokim sent forth the Spirit of his Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17).

<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Howbeit at that time, not knowing Elokim, ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> but now that ye have come to know Elokim, or rather to be known by Elokim, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again?  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I beseech you, brethren, become as I am, for I also am become as ye are.
<br>
 Ye did me no wrong: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the Holy Injil unto you the first time: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of Elokim, even as [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Al-Masih be formed in youâ€™ 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For it is written, that Ibrahim (Abraham) had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Howbeit the son by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Which things contain an allegory: for these women are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For it is written,
<br>
Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not;
<br>
Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not:
<br>
For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath the husband.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Now we, brethren, as Ishaq (Isaac) was, are children of promise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, so also it is now.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.
