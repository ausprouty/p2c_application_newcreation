<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; set to Shoshannim. A Psalm of Dawad) Save me, O Elokim;
<br>
For the waters are come in unto my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing:
<br>
I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I am weary with my crying; my throat is dried:
<br>
Mine eyes fail while I wait for my Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head:
<br>
They that would cut me off, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty:
<br>
That which I took not away I have to restore.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> O Elokim, thou knowest my foolishness;
<br>
And my sins are not hid from thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Let not them that wait for thee be put to shame through me, O Lord تتراجراماتون of hosts:
<br>
Let not those that seek thee be brought to dishonor through me, O Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Because for thy sake I have borne reproach;
<br>
Shame hath covered my face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I am become a stranger unto my brethren,
<br>
And an alien unto my mother’s children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up;
<br>
And the reproaches of them that reproach thee are fallen upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting,
<br>
That was to my reproach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> When I made sackcloth my clothing,
<br>
I became a byword unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> They that sit in the gate talk of me;
<br>
And I am the song of the drunkards.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O تتراجراماتون, in an acceptable time:
<br>
O Elokim, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness,
<br>
Answer me in the truth of thy salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink:
<br>
Let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Let not the waterflood overwhelm me,
<br>
Neither let the deep swallow me up;
<br>
And let not the pit shut its mouth upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Answer me, O تتراجراماتون; for thy lovingkindness is good:
<br>
According to the multitude of thy tender mercies turn thou unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And hide not thy face from thy servant;
<br>
For I am in distress; answer me speedily.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it:
<br>
Ransom me because of mine enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thou knowest my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonor:
<br>
Mine adversaries are all before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness:
<br>
And I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;
<br>
And for comforters, but I found none.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> They gave me also gall for my food;
<br>
And in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Let their table before them become a snare;
<br>
And when they are in peace, let it become a trap.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, so that they cannot see;
<br>
And make their loins continually to shake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Pour out thine indignation upon them,
<br>
And let the fierceness of thine anger overtake them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Let their habitation be desolate;
<br>
Let none dwell in their tents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten;
<br>
And they tell of the sorrow of those whom thou hast wounded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Add iniquity unto their iniquity;
<br>
And let them not come into thy righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Let them be blotted out of the book of life,
<br>
And not be written with the righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But I am poor and sorrowful:
<br>
Let thy salvation, O Elokim, set me up on high.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> I will praise the name of Elokim with a song,
<br>
And will magnify him with thanksgiving.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And it will please تتراجراماتون better than an ox,
<br>
Or a bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> The meek have seen it, and are glad:
<br>
Ye that seek after Elokim, let your heart live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> For تتراجراماتون heareth the needy,
<br>
And despiseth not his prisoners.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Let heaven and earth praise him,
<br>
The seas, and everything that moveth therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> For Elokim will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah;
<br>
And they shall abide there, and have it in possession.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> The seed also of his servants shall inherit it;
<br>
And they that love his name shall dwell therein.
