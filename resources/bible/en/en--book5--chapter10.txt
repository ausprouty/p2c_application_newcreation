<sup class="versenum">1</sup> At that time تتراجراماتون said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which تتراجراماتون spoke unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and تتراجراماتون gave them unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And I turned and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as تتراجراماتون commanded me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> (And the children of Israel journeyed from Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah.
<br>
 There Haron (Aaron) died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest’s office in his stead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> From thence they journeyed unto GudElokimah; and from GudElokimah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> At that time تتراجراماتون set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون, to stand before تتراجراماتون to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Wherefore Levi hath no portion nor inheritance with his brethren; تتراجراماتون is his inheritance, according as تتراجراماتون thy Elokim spoke unto him).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And I stayed in the mount, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and تتراجراماتون hearkened unto me that time also; تتراجراماتون would not destroy thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And now, Israel, what doth تتراجراماتون thy Elokim require of thee, but to fear تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve تتراجراماتون thy Elokim with all thy heart and with all thy soul, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> to keep the commandments of تتراجراماتون, and his statutes, which I command thee this day for thy good? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Behold, unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim belongeth heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Only تتراجراماتون had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For تتراجراماتون your Elokim, he is Elokim of Elokim, and Lord of lords, the great Elokim, the mighty, and the terrible, who regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He doth execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loveth the sojourner, in giving him food and raiment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Love ye therefore the sojourner; for ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Thou shalt fear تتراجراماتون thy Elokim; him shalt thou serve; and to him shalt thou cleave, and by his name shalt thou swear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He is thy praise, and he is thy Elokim, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten persons; and now تتراجراماتون thy Elokim hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude.
