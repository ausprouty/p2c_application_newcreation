<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then Yusuf (Joseph) went in and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And from among his brethren he took five men, and presented them unto Pharaoh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both we, and our fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And they said unto Pharaoh, To sojourn in the land are we come; for there is no pasture for thy servants’ flocks; for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore, we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Pharaoh spoke unto Yusuf (Joseph), saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell: and if thou knowest any able men among them, then make them rulers over my cattle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) brought in Ya’qub (Jacob) his father, and set him before Pharaoh: and Ya’qub (Jacob) blessed Pharaoh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Pharaoh said unto Ya’qub (Jacob), How many are the days of the years of thy life? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years: few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his father’s household, with bread, according to their families.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought: and Yusuf (Joseph) brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Yusuf (Joseph), and said, Give us bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for our money faileth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for your cattle, if money fail.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And they brought their cattle unto Yusuf (Joseph); and Yusuf (Joseph) gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And when that year was ended, they came unto him the second year, and said unto him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my lord’s; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies, and our lands: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> wherefore should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not desolate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> So Yusuf (Joseph) bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine was sore upon them: and the land became Pharaoh’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And as for the people, he removed them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Only the land of the priests bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8</sup>:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] he not: for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold not their land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Then Yusuf (Joseph) said unto the people, Behold, I have bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] you this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your households, and for food for your little ones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; only the land of the priests alone became not Pharaoh’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gat them possessions therein, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the days of Ya’qub (Jacob), the years of his life, were a hundred forty and seven years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And the time drew near that Israel must die: and he called his son Yusuf (Joseph), and said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me: bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And he said, Swear unto me: and he sware unto him.
<br>
 And Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.
