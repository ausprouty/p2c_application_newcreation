<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the courses of the sons of Haron (Aaron) were these.
<br>
 The sons of Haron (Aaron): Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest’s office.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And David (Dawad) with Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, divided them according to their ordering in their service.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and thus were they divided: of the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen, heads of fathers’ houses; and of the sons of Ithamar, according to their fathers’ houses, eight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for there were princes of the sanctuary, and princes of Elokim, both of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Shemaiah the son of Nethanel the scribe, who was of the Levites, wrote them in the presence of the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and of the Levites; one fathers’ house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,

<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> the nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezkel,

<sup class="versenum">17</sup> the one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to Gamul, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> the three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to Maaziah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> This was the ordering of them in their service, to come into the house of تتراجراماتون according to the ordinance given unto them by Haron (Aaron) their father, as تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, had commanded him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And of the rest of the sons of Levi: of the sons of ‘Imran (Amram), Shubael; of the sons of Shubael, Jehdeiah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Of Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, Isshiah the chief.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Of the Izharites, Shelomoth; of the sons of Shelomoth, Jahath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And the sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> The sons of Uzziel, Micah; of the sons of Micah, Shamir.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> The brother of Micah, Isshiah; of the sons of Isshiah, Zechariah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi; the sons of Jaaziah: Beno.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> The sons of Merari: of Jaaziah, Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur, and Ibri.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Of Mahli: Eleazar, who had no sons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Of Kish; the sons of Kish: Jerahmeel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And the sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth.
<br>
 These were the sons of the Levites after their fathers’ houses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> These likewise cast lots even as their brethren the sons of Haron (Aaron) in the presence of David (Dawad) the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the priests and of the Levites; the fathers’ houses of the chief even as those of his younger brother.
