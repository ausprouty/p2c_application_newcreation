<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto me, Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it with the pen of a man, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and I will take unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a son.
<br>
 Then said تتراجراماتون unto me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto me yet again, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Forasmuch as this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> now therefore, behold, HaAdon bringeth up upon them the waters of the River, strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his glory: and it shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and it shall sweep onward into Judah; it shall overflow and pass through; it shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of its wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for Elokim is with us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For تتراجراماتون spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Say ye not, A conspiracy, concerning all whereof this people shall say, A conspiracy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be in dread thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> تتراجراماتون of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And many shall stumble thereon, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Bind thou up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And I will wait for تتراجراماتون, that hideth his face from the house of Ya’qub (Jacob), and I will look for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Behold, I and the children whom تتراجراماتون hath given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from تتراجراماتون of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Zion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto the wizards, that chirp and that mutter: should not a people seek unto their Elokim? on behalf of the living should they seek unto the dead? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> To the law and to the testimony! if they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they shall pass through it, sore distressed and hungry; and it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their Elokim, and turn their faces upward: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> and they shall look unto the earth, and, behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and into thick darkness they shall be driven away.
