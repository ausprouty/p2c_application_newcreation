<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> as when fire kindleth the brushwood, and the fire causeth the waters to boil; to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen a Elokim besides thee, who worketh for him that waiteth for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wast wroth, and we sinned: in them have we been of long time; and shall we be saved? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For we are all become as one that is unclean, and all our righteousnesses are as a polluted garment: and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us by means of our iniquities.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But now, O تتراجراماتون, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Be not wroth very sore, O تتراجراماتون, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O تتراجراماتون? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
