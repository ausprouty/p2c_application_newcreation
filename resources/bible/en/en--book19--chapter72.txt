<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Psalm of Solomon) Give the king thy judgments, O Elokim,
<br>
And thy righteousness unto the king’s son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> He will judge thy people with righteousness,
<br>
And thy poor with justice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The mountains shall bring peace to the people,
<br>
And the hills, in righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He will judge the poor of the people,
<br>
He will save the children of the needy,
<br>
And will break in pieces the oppressor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They shall fear thee while the sun endureth,
<br>
And so long as the moon, throughout all generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He will come down like rain upon the mown grass,
<br>
As showers that water the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> In his days shall the righteous flourish,
<br>
And abundance of peace, till the moon be no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
<br>
And from the River unto the ends of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him;
<br>
And his enemies shall lick the dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall render tribute:
<br>
The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Yea, all kings shall fall down before him;
<br>
All nations shall serve him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For he will deliver the needy when he crieth,
<br>
And the poor, that hath no helper.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He will have pity on the poor and needy,
<br>
And the souls of the needy he will save.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence;
<br>
And precious will their blood be in his sight:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And they shall live; and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba:
<br>
And men shall pray for him continually;
<br>
They shall bless him all the day long.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> There shall be abundance of grain in the earth upon the top of the mountains;
<br>
The fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon:
<br>
And they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> His name shall endure for ever;
<br>
His name shall be continued as long as the sun:
<br>
And men shall be blessed in him;
<br>
All nations shall call him happy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Blessed be تتراجراماتون Elokim, the Elokim of Israel,
<br>
Who only doeth wondrous things:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And blessed be his glorious name for ever;
<br>
And let the whole earth be filled with his glory.
<br>
Amen, and Amen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> The prayers of David (Dawad) the son of Jesse are ended.
