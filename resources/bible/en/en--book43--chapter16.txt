<sup class="versenum">1</sup> These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be caused to stumble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you shall think that he offereth service unto Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And these things will they do, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But these things have I spoken unto you, that when their hour is come, ye may remember them, how that I told you.
<br>
 And these things I said not unto you from the beginning, because I was with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But now I go unto him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But because I have spoken these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I go, I will send him unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he, when he is come, will convict the world in respect of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> of sin, because they believe not on me; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> of righteousness, because I go to the Father, and ye behold me no more; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> of judgment, because the prince of this world hath been judged.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he shall guide you into all the truth: for he shall not speak from himself; but what things soever he shall hear, these shall he speak: and he shall declare unto you the things that are to come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> He shall glorify me: for he shall take of mine, and shall declare it unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> All things whatsoever the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he taketh of mine, and shall declare it unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> A little while, and ye behold me no more; and again a little while, and ye shall see me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Some of his disciples therefore said one to another, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye behold me not; and again a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? We know not what he saith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]perceived that they were desirous to ask him, and he said unto them, Do ye inquire among yourselves concerning this, that I said, A little while, and ye behold me not, and again a little while, and ye shall see me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for the joy that a man is born into the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And ye therefore now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one taketh away from you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And in that day ye shall ask me no question.
<br>
 Verily, verily, I say unto you, If ye shall ask anything of the Father, he will give it you in my name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be made full.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> These things have I spoken unto you in dark sayings: the hour cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in dark sayings, but shall tell you plainly of the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> In that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> for the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> I came out from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go unto the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> His disciples say, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no dark saying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Now know we that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered them, Do ye now believe?<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> These things have I spoken unto you, that in me ye may have peace.
<br>
 In the world ye have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
