<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Hear ye this, O house of Ya’qub (Jacob), who are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah; who swear by the name of تتراجراماتون, and make mention of the Elokim of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> (for they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the Elokim of Israel; تتراجراماتون of hosts is his name): 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I have declared the former things from of old; yea, they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them: suddenly I did them, and they came to pass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow brass; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> therefore I have declared it to thee from of old; before it came to pass I showed it thee; lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, hath commanded them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thou hast heard it; behold all this; and ye, will ye not declare it? I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, which thou hast not known.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> They are created now, and not from of old; and before this day thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from of old thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou didst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For my name’s sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Behold, I have refined thee, but not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do it; for how should my name be profaned? and my glory will I not give to another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Hearken unto me, O Ya’qub (Jacob), and Israel my called: I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Yea, my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spread out the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Assemble yourselves, all ye, and hear; who among them hath declared these things? He whom تتراجراماتون loveth shall perform his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; from the beginning I have not spoken in secret; from the time that it was, there am I: and now HaAdon تتراجراماتون hath sent me, and his Spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: I am تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the grains thereof: his name would not be cut off nor destroyed from before me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Go ye forth from Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans; with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth: say ye, تتراجراماتون hath redeemed his servant Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock also, and the waters gushed out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> There is no peace, saith تتراجراماتون, to the wicked.
