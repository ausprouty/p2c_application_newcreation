<sup class="versenum">1</sup>And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Take Haron (Aaron) and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Musa did as تتراجراماتون commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Musa said unto the congregation, This is the thing which تتراجراماتون hath commanded to be done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Musa brought Haron (Aaron) and his sons, and washed them with water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he placed the breastplate upon him: and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Musa took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he poured of the anointing oil upon Haron (Aaron)’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Musa brought Haron (Aaron)’s sons, and clothed them with coats, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he brought the bullock of the sin-offering: and Haron (Aaron) and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he slew it; and Musa took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Musa burned it upon the altar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he presented the ram of the burnt-offering: and Haron (Aaron) and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he killed it; and Musa sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he cut the ram into its pieces; and Musa burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he washed the inwards and the legs with water; and Musa burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون; as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And he presented the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Haron (Aaron) and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he slew it; and Musa took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Haron (Aaron)’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And he brought Haron (Aaron)’s sons; and Musa put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot: and Musa sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before تتراجراماتون, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> and he put the whole upon the hands of Haron (Aaron), and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Musa took them from off their hands, and burnt them on the altar upon the burnt-offering: they were a consecration for a sweet savor: it was an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Musa took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before تتراجراماتون: it was Musa’ portion of the ram of consecration; as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And Musa took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Haron (Aaron), upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Haron (Aaron), his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And Musa said unto Haron (Aaron) and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting: and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, Haron (Aaron) and his sons shall eat it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled: for he shall consecrate you seven days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> As hath been done this day, so تتراجراماتون hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of تتراجراماتون, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And Haron (Aaron) and his sons did all the things which تتراجراماتون commanded by Musa.
