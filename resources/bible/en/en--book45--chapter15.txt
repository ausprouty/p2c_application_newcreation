<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Let each one of us please his neighbor for that which is good, unto edifying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For Al-Masih also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Now the Elokim of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the Elokim and Father of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Al-Masih also received you, to the glory of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For I say that Al-Masih hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of Elokim, that he might confirm the promises given unto the fathers, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and that the Gentiles might glorify Elokim for his mercy; as it is written,
<br>
Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles,
<br>
And sing unto thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And again he saith,
<br>
Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And again,
<br>
Praise HaAdon, all ye Gentiles;
<br>
And let all the peoples praise him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And again, Isaiah saith,
<br>
There shall be the root of Jesse,
<br>
And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles;
<br>
On him shall the Gentiles hope.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Now the Elokim of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Ruach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of Elokim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> that I should be a minister of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]unto the Gentiles, ministering the Holy Injil of Elokim, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ruach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> I have therefore my glorying in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]in things pertaining to Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For I will not dare to speak of any things except those which al-Masih wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,<sup class="versenum">19</sup> in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ruach; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the Holy Injil of al-Masih; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> yea, making it my aim so to preach the Holy Injil, not where al-Masih was already named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> but, as it is written,
<br>
They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came,
<br>
And they who have not heard shall understand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:Romans 
<br>
15:23	 but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)’ 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> but now, I say, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are.
<br>
 For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister unto them in carnal things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to Elokim for me; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and that my ministration which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> that I may come unto you in joy through the will of Elokim, and together with you find rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Now the Elokim of peace be with you all.
<br>
 Amen.
