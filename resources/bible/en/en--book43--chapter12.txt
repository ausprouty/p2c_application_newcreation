<sup class="versenum">1</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]raised from the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for the sake of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was coming to Jerusalem, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of HaAdon, even the King of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an assâ€™s colt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing; lo, the world is gone after him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Bar Enosh should be glorified.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour.
<br>
 But for this cause came I unto this hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Father, glorify thy name.
<br>
 There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that al-Masih abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Bar Enosh must be lifted up? who is this Bar Enosh? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you.
<br>
 Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light.
<br>
These things spoke [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and he departed and hid himself from them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke,
<br>
Lord, who hath believed our report?
<br>
And to whom hath the arm of HaAdon been revealed?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart;
<br>
Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart,
<br>
And should turn,
<br>
And I should heal them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spoke of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spoke, the same shall judge him in the last day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> For I spoke not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And I know that his commandment is life eternal; the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.
