<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I made a covenant with mine eyes;
<br>
How then should I look upon a virgin?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For what is the portion from Elokim above,
<br>
And the heritage from the Almighty on high?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Is it not calamity to the unrighteous,
<br>
And disaster to the workers of iniquity?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Doth not he see my ways,
<br>
And number all my steps?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> If I have walked with falsehood,
<br>
And my foot hath hasted to deceit
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> (Let me be weighed in an even balance,
<br>
That Elokim may know mine integrity);
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> If my step hath turned out of the way,
<br>
And my heart walked after mine eyes,
<br>
And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then let me sow, and let another eat;
<br>
Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman,
<br>
And I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Then let my wife grind unto another,
<br>
And let others bow down upon her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For that were a heinous crime;
<br>
Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction,
<br>
And would root out all mine increase.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant,
<br>
When they contended with me;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> What then shall I do when Elokim riseth up?
<br>
And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Did not he that made me in the womb make him?
<br>
And did not one fashion us in the womb?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> If I have withheld the poor from their desire,
<br>
Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Or have eaten my morsel alone,
<br>
And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> (Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father,
<br>
And her have I guided from my mother’s womb);
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> If I have seen any perish for want of clothing,
<br>
Or that the needy had no covering;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> If his loins have not blessed me,
<br>
And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless,
<br>
Because I saw my help in the gate:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade,
<br>
And mine arm be broken from the bone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For calamity from Elokim is a terror to me,
<br>
And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> If I have made gold my hope,
<br>
And have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great,
<br>
And because my hand had gotten much;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> If I have beheld the sun when it shined,
<br>
Or the moon walking in brightness,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And my heart hath been secretly enticed,
<br>
And my mouth hath kissed my hand:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges;
<br>
For I should have denied the Elokim that is above.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me,
<br>
Or lifted up myself when evil found him
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> (Yea, I have not suffered by mouth to sin
<br>
By asking his life with a curse);
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> If the men of my tent have not said,
<br>
Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> (The sojourner hath not lodged in the street;
<br>
But I have opened my doors to the traveller);
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> If like Adam I have covered my transgressions,
<br>
By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Because I feared the great multitude,
<br>
And the contempt of families terrified me,
<br>
So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door’
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Oh that I had one to hear me!
<br>
(Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me)
<br>
And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder;
<br>
I would bind it unto me as a crown:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> I would declare unto him the number of my steps;
<br>
As a prince would I go near unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> If my land crieth out against me,
<br>
And the furrows thereof weep together;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money,
<br>
Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> Let thistles grow instead of wheat,
<br>
And cockle instead of barley.
<br>
The words of Ayyub (Job) are ended.
