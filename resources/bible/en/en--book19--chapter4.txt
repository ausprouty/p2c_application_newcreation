<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments.
<br>
 A Psalm of Dawad). Answer me when I call, O Elokim of my righteousness;
<br>
Thou hast set me at large when I was in distress:
<br>
Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor?
<br>
How long will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood?
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But know that تتراجراماتون hath set apart for himself him that is godly:
<br>
تتراجراماتون will hear when I call unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Stand in awe, and sin not:
<br>
Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness,
<br>
And put your trust in تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Many there are that say, Who will show us any good?
<br>
تتراجراماتون, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Thou hast put gladness in my heart,
<br>
More than they have when their grain and their new wine are increased.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep;
<br>
For thou, تتراجراماتون, alone makest me dwell in safety.
