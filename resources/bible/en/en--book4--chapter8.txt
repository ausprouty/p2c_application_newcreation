<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Speak unto Haron (Aaron), and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the candlestick.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Haron (Aaron) did so; he lighted the lamps thereof so as to give light in front of the candlestick, as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And this was the work of the candlestick, beaten work of gold; unto the base thereof, and unto the flowers thereof, it was beaten work: according unto the pattern which تتراجراماتون had showed Musa, so he made the candlestick.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of expiation upon them, and let them cause a razor to pass over all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then let them take a young bullock, and its meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And thou shalt present the Levites before the tent of meeting: and thou shalt assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and thou shalt present the Levites before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
 And the children of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and Haron (Aaron) shall offer the Levites before تتراجراماتون for a wave-offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and offer thou the one for a sin-offering, and the other for a burnt-offering, unto تتراجراماتون, to make atonement for the Levites.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And thou shalt set the Levites before Haron (Aaron), and before his sons, and offer them for a wave-offering unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tent of meeting: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for a wave-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of all that openeth the womb, even the first-born of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For all the first-born among the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And I have taken the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And I have given the Levites as a gift to Haron (Aaron) and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tent of meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Thus did Musa, and Haron (Aaron), and all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the Levites: according unto all that تتراجراماتون commanded Musa touching the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And the Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes: and Haron (Aaron) offered them for a wave-offering before تتراجراماتون; and Haron (Aaron) made atonement for them to cleanse them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Haron (Aaron), and before his sons: as تتراجراماتون had commanded Musa concerning the Levites, so did they unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> This is that which belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service in the work of the tent of meeting 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the work, and shall serve no more, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> but shall minister with their brethren in the tent of meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charges.
