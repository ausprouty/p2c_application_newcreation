<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup> And David (Dawad) consulted with the captains of thousands and of hundreds, even with every leader.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto all the assembly of Israel, If it seem good unto you, and if it be of تتراجراماتون our Elokim, let us send abroad every where unto our brethren that are left in all the land of Israel, with whom the priests and Levites are in their cities that have suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and let us bring again the ark of our Elokim to us: for we sought not unto it in the days of Saul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And all the assembly said that they would do so; for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> So David (Dawad) assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor the brook of Egypt even unto the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of Elokim from Kiriath-jearim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And David (Dawad) went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kiriath-jearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of Elokim تتراجراماتون that sitteth above the cherubim, that is called by the Name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they carried the ark of Elokim upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And David (Dawad) and all Israel played before Elokim with all their might, even with songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And when they came unto the threshing-floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the anger of تتراجراماتون was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put forth his hand to the ark; and there he died before Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And David (Dawad) was displeased, because تتراجراماتون had broken forth upon Uzza: and he called that place Perez-uzza, unto this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And David (Dawad) was afraid of Elokim that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of Elokim home to me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> So David (Dawad) removed not the ark unto him into the city of David (Dawad), but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the ark of Elokim remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months: and تتراجراماتون blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.
