<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for تتراجراماتون hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The ox knoweth his owner [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41], and the donkey his master’s crib; but Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly! they have forsaken تتراجراماتون, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged and gone backward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Except تتراجراماتون of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Hear the word of تتراجراماتون, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our Elokim, ye people of Gomorrah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith تتراجراماتون: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,’I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Come now, and let us reason together, saith تتراجراماتون: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of تتراجراماتون hath spoken it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Therefore saith HaAdon, تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake تتراجراماتون shall be consumed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.
