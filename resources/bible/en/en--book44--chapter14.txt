<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of Jews and of Greeks believed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But the Jews that were disobedient stirred up the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil affected against the brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Long time therefore they tarried there speaking boldly in HaAdon, who bare witness unto the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But the multitude of the city was divided; and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And when there was made an onset both of the Gentiles and of the Jews with their rulers, to treat them shamefully and to stone them, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> they became aware of it, and fled unto the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe, and the region round about: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and there they preached the Holy Injil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And at Lystra there sat a certain man, impotent in his feet, a cripple from his motherâ€™s womb, who never had walked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The same heard Paul speaking: who, fastening his eyes upon him, and seeing that he had faith to be made whole, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet.
<br>
 And he leaped up and walked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And when the multitude saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voice, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The Elokim are come down to us in the likeness of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the priest of Jupiter whose temple was before the city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the multitudes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their garments, and sprang forth among the multitude, crying out 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and bring you good tidings, that ye should turn from these vain things unto a living Elokim, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> who in the generations gone by suffered all the nations to walk in their own ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And yet he left not himself without witness, in that he did good and gave you from heaven rains and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And with these sayings scarce restrained they the multitudes from doing sacrifice unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But there came Jews thither from Antioch and Iconium: and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul, and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and entered into the city: and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And when they had preached the Holy Injil to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when they had appointed for them elders in every New Creation Masjid, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to HaAdon, on whom they had believed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And they passed through Pisidia, and came to Pamphylia.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and thence they sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of Elokim for the work which they had fulfilled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And when they were come, and had gathered the New Creation Masjid together, they rehearsed all things that Elokim had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith unto the Gentiles.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And they tarried no little time with the disciples.
