<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I charge thee in the sight of [Atik Yomin] Elokim, and of [Bar Enosh] [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom [T.N.Ecclesiastes 4:12 says, And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. Inerrantly Scripturally taught is that   تتراجراماتون  is ECHAD in His Underlying Being and MESHULLESHET (threefold) in the personal distinctions of His Kedushah.  Kedushah meshulleshet (Threefold Holiness). The Ancient of Days [Elokim HaAv] bestowing upon the Son of Man [Elokim HaBen, Isa al-Masih] honor and a kingdom in Daniel 7:13-14 would indicate that there is a personal distinction between the two. Why is this important? We are pulled out of the peril of the deep and into al-Masih's boat of salvation by ONE rope which is a THREEFOLD cord: Atik Yomin through whom our salvation is originated (Daniel 7:13-14; Ephesians 1:3-6) draws us , the Holy Ruach convicts us (John 16::8), and the Bar Enosh redeems us (Mark 10:45; Exodus 12:13; Isaiah 53:7; John 14:6). This is best illustrated by the following.  In my heart there is a Masjid, a small prayer room.  Small but commodious, stretching out like Ibrahim’s Tent into eternity.  There I meditate day and night. I invite you to look around this Masjid of my soul. You will see first a raised platform, a Minbar, and that Minbar is where the free prayer is made lying face down, under the holy light shining. One day in this Masjid of the heart, I heard a soft rapping at the door. I looked at the door and saw that sacrificial blood had been struck against the uprights. I looked at the latch. What would happen if I opened it?  I had been meditating on the door standing open in heaven.  I was thinking about heaven and the Bar Enosh (Whom All Will Serve as Deity) coming to the Ancient of Days on the clouds of heaven. I wanted the Spirit to lift me up and take me in visions of the Holy One far above my dark racing thoughts which are vain. My eyes examined the Blood on the lintel. I seemed to know that my dark vain thoughts must be at all times expiated by the Blood of the lintel, lest the Evil one defile my innermost Masjid,  On the table of that Masjid is a candle which is a lamp unto my feet and an Injil Scroll which is a light unto my path, that the Holy One might be with me and that my thoughts might be acceptable in His sight. Again, I heard a soft rapping at the door. I knew whoever knocked was standing behind the wall.  And I looked, and, behold, the glory cloud filled the Masjid. The door was locked.  But I sensed my soul under scrutiny. Again I heard the soft rapping at the door. In my heart there is a Masjid, a small prayer room.  Small but commodious, stretching out like Ibrahim’s Tent into eternity. From that vantage point there is another Comforter, the  Holy Ruach.And also the Bar Enosh Masih and the Ancient of Days.  Three. In the Torat, Ibrahim looked out the entrance of his Tent and saw Three. Yet His Name is One.  But when the door opened, there was only a Lamb.  The Lamb was standing.  It had the appearance of having been slaughtered.  Its throat was cut and the bloody mortal wound was a sign that the desolating plague had skipped or passed over my door.Then I heard the Voice. "If anyone will invite me to come in, I will come in." In the darkness of my soul, I reached toward the Light of the World that was shining. His glance fell on the Injil Scroll like a laser, lighting every Letter and every fiery place which speaks of him in every Word. As far as this Masjid is concerned and also my dark thoughts, things are rising brighter now since Isa al-Masih pbuh entered the Masjid of my heart.]

See 2 Samuel 18:9-33; only the death of the Son of David on the tree brings al-Salaam peace, Isaiah 53:5, but a bearer of tidings must run with this Good News, like Philip the Mevaser, Acts 8:30), fulfil thy ministry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which HaAdon, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Give diligence to come shortly unto me: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

 Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.

<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: HaAdon will render to him according to his works: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But HaAdon stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
