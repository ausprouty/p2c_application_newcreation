<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> What then shall we say that Ibrahim (Abraham), our forefather, hath found according to the flesh?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For if Ibrahim (Abraham) was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory; but not toward Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For what saith the scripture? And Ibrahim (Abraham) believed Elokim, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned as of grace, but as of debt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reckoned for righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Even as David (Dawad) also pronounceth blessing upon the man, unto whom Elokim reckoneth righteousness apart from works, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> saying,
<br>
Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven,
<br>
And whose sins are covered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Blessed is the man to whom HaAdon will not reckon sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Is this blessing then pronounced upon the circumcision, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say, To Ibrahim (Abraham) his faith was reckoned for righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> How then was it reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had while he was in uncircumcision: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be in uncircumcision, that righteousness might be reckoned unto them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and the father of circumcision to them who not only are of the circumcision, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Ibrahim (Abraham) which he had in uncircumcision.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For not through the law was the promise to Ibrahim (Abraham) or to his seed that he should be heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For if they that are of the law are heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> for the law worketh wrath; but where there is no law, neither is there transgression.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For this cause it is of faith, that it may be according to grace; to the end that the promise may be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Ibrahim (Abraham), who is the father of us all 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> (as it is written, A father of many nations have I made thee) before him whom he believed, even Elokim, who giveth life to the dead, and calleth the things that are not, as though they were.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Who in hope believed against hope, to the end that he might become a father of many nations, according to that which had been spoken, So shall thy seed be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And without being weakened in faith he considered his own body now as good as dead (he being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarahâ€™s womb; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> yet, looking unto the promise of Elokim, he wavered not through unbelief, but waxed strong through faith, giving glory to Elokim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and being fully assured that what he had promised, he was able also to perform.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Wherefore also it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was reckoned unto him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> but for our sake also, unto whom it shall be reckoned, who believe on him that raised [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]our Lord from the dead, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> who was delivered up for our trespasses, and was raised for our justification.
