<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest it, and dwellest therein,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which thou shalt bring in from thy land that تتراجراماتون thy Elokim giveth thee; and thou shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go unto the place which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And thou shalt come unto the priest that shall be in those days, and say unto him, I profess this day unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, that I am come unto the land which تتراجراماتون sware unto our fathers to give us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And the priest shall take the basket out of thy hand, and set it down before the altar of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And thou shalt answer and say before تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, A Syrian ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid upon us hard bondage: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and we cried unto تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of our fathers, and تتراجراماتون heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil, and our oppression; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and تتراجراماتون brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and with signs, and with wonders; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground, which thou, O تتراجراماتون, hast given me.
<br>
 And thou shalt set it down before تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, and worship before تتراجراماتون thy Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and thou shalt rejoice in all the good which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim hath given unto thee, and unto thy house, thou, and the Levite, and the sojourner that is in the midst of thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithe of thine increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, then thou shalt give it unto the Levite, to the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be filled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And thou shalt say before تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, I have put away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the sojourner, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy commandment which thou hast commanded me: I have not transgressed any of thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them<sup class="versenum"> 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I put away thereof, being unclean, nor given thereof for the dead: I have hearkened to the voice of تتراجراماتون my Elokim; I have done according to all that thou hast commanded me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the ground which thou hast given us, as thou swarest unto our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> This day تتراجراماتون thy Elokim commandeth thee to do these statutes and ordinances: thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Thou hast avouched تتراجراماتون this day to be thy Elokim, and that thou wouldest walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his ordinances, and hearken unto his voice: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and تتراجراماتون hath avouched thee this day to be a people for his own possession, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and to make thee high above all nations that he hath made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that thou mayest be a holy people unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, as he hath spoken.
