<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Psalm of Dawad) I will sing of lovingkindness and justice:
<br>
Unto thee, O تتراجراماتون, will I sing praises.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way:
<br>
Oh when wilt thou come unto me?
<br>
I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I will set no base thing before mine eyes:
<br>
I hate the work of them that turn aside;
<br>
It shall not cleave unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> A perverse heart shall depart from me:
<br>
I will know no evil thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Whoso privily slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy:
<br>
Him that hath a high look and a proud heart will I not suffer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me:
<br>
He that walketh in a perfect way, he shall minister unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house:
<br>
He that speaketh falsehood shall not be established before mine eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land;
<br>
To cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of تتراجراماتون.
