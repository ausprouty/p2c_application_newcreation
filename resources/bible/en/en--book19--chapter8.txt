<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith.
<br>
 A Psalm of Dawad). O تتراجراماتون, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth,
<br>
Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength,
<br>
Because of thine adversaries,
<br>
That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers,
<br>
The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
<br>
And the son of man, that thou visitest him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For thou hast made him but little lower than Elokim,
<br>
And crownest him with glory and honor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
<br>
Thou hast put all things under his feet:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> All sheep and oxen,
<br>
Yea, and the beasts of the field,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,
<br>
Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> O تتراجراماتون, our Lord,
<br>
How excellent is thy name in all the earth!
