<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto تتراجراماتون from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the man Micah had a house of Elokim, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place, and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
<br>
 So the Levite went in.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then said Micah, Now know I that تتراجراماتون will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.
