<sup class="versenum">1</sup> My little children, these things write I unto you that ye may not sin.
<br>
 And if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] the righteous: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> but whoso keepeth his word, in him verily hath the love of Elokim been perfected.
<br>
 Hereby we know that we are in him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also to walk even as he walked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Beloved, no new commandment write I unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning: the old commandment is the word which ye heard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Again, a new commandment write I unto you, which thing is true in him and in you; because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shineth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother, is in the darkness even until now.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But he that hateth his brother is in the darkness, and walketh in the darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness hath blinded his eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I write unto you, my little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his nameâ€™s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I write unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the evil one.
<br>
 I have written unto you, little children, because ye know the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I have written unto you, fathers, because ye know him who is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of Elokim abideth in you, and ye have overcome the evil one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of Elokim abideth for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Little children, it is the last hour: and as ye heard that antiMasih cometh, even now have there arisen many antimasihs; whereby we know that it is the last hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they all are not of us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and ye know all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Who is the liar but he that denieth that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] is al-Masih? This is the antimasih, even he that denieth the [Atik Yomin] Father and the [Bar Enosh] Son [T.N. See Daniel 7:13-14. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Whosoever denieth the [Bar Enosh] Son, the same hath not the [Atik Yomin] Father: he that confesseth the [Bar Enosh] Son hath the [Atik Yomin] Father also [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1).

<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> As for you, let that abide in you which ye heard from the beginning. If that which ye heard from the beginning abide in you, ye also shall abide in the [Bar Enosh] Son, and in the [Atik Yomin] Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And this is the promise which he promised us, even the life eternal.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> These things have I written unto you concerning them that would lead you astray.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And as for you, the anointing which ye received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any one teach you; but as his anointing teacheth you concerning all things, and is true, and is no lie, and even as it taught you, ye abide in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And now, my little children, abide in him; that, if he shall be manifested, we may have boldness, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one also that doeth righteousness is begotten of him.
