<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (A Prayer of Dawad) Hear the right, O تتراجراماتون, attend unto my cry;
<br>
Give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Let my sentence come forth from thy presence;
<br>
Let thine eyes look upon equity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night;
<br>
Thou hast tried me, and findest nothing;
<br>
I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips
<br>
I have kept me from the ways of the violent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> My steps have held fast to thy paths,
<br>
My feet have not slipped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I have called upon thee, for thou wilt answer me, O Elokim:
<br>
Incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Show thy marvellous lovingkindness,
<br>
O thou that savest by thy right hand them that take refuge in thee
<br>
From those that rise up against them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Keep me as the apple of the eye;
<br>
Hide me under the shadow of thy wings,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> From the wicked that oppress me,
<br>
My deadly enemies, that compass me about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> They are inclosed in their own fat:
<br>
With their mouth they speak proudly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> They have now compassed us in our steps;
<br>
They set their eyes to cast us down to the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> He is like a lion that is greedy of his prey,
<br>
And as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Arise, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Confront him, cast him down:
<br>
Deliver my soul from the wicked by thy sword;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> From men by thy hand, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
From men of the world, whose portion is in this life,
<br>
And whose belly thou fillest with thy treasure:
<br>
They are satisfied with children,
<br>
And leave the rest of their substance to their babes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> As for me, I shall behold thy face in righteousness;
<br>
I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with beholding thy form.
