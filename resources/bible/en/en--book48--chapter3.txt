<sup class="versenum">1</sup> O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] was openly set forth pierced alive on the Tree [see 2Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid pierced hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a mevaser announcer of Good News of al-Salaam (2 Timothy 4:5) to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5]?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Even as Ibrahim (Abraham) believed Elokim, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Ibrahim (Abraham).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the scripture, foreseeing that Elokim would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Holy Injil beforehand unto Ibrahim (Abraham), saying, In thee shall all the nations be blessed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Ibrahim (Abraham).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now that no man is justified by the law before Elokim, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Al-Masih redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Ibrahim (Abraham) in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Now to Ibrahim (Abraham) were the promises spoken, and to his seed.
<br>
 He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by Elokim, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but Elokim hath granted it to Ibrahim (Abraham) by promise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but Elokim is one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Is the law then against the promises of Elokim? Elokim forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But the scripture shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] might be given to them that believe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> So that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto Al-Masih, that we might be justified by faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For ye are all sons of Elokim, through faith, in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For as many of you as were baptized into al-Masih did put on al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one man in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And if ye are al-Masih’s, then are ye Ibrahim’s (Abraham’s) seed, heirs according to promise.
