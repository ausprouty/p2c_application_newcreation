<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the barbarians showed us no common kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And when the barbarians saw the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius; who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked Elokim, and took courage.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with me: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded the matter, testifying the kingdom of Elokim, and persuading them concerning [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], both from the law of Musa and from the prophets, from morning till evening.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Ruach through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> saying,
<br>
Go thou unto this people, and say,
<br>
By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand;
<br>
And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For this peopleâ€™s heart is waxed gross,
<br>
And their ears are dull of hearing,
<br>
And their eyes they have closed;
<br>
Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes,
<br>
And hear with their ears,
<br>
And understand with their heart,
<br>
And should turn again,
<br>
And I should heal them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of Elokim is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And when he said these things, the Yehudim departed, and argued greatly among themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> preaching the kingdom of Elokim, and teaching the things concerning HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] with all boldness, none forbidding him.
