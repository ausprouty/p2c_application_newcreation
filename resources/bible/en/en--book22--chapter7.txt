<sup class="versenum">1</sup> How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince’s daughter!
<br>
Thy rounded thighs are like jewels,
<br>
The work of the hands of a skilful workman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thy body is like a round goblet,
<br>
Wherein no mingled wine is wanting:
<br>
Thy waist is like a heap of wheat
<br>
Set about with lilies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thy two breasts are like two fawns
<br>
That are twins of a roe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thy neck is like the tower of ivory;
<br>
Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon,
<br>
By the gate of Bath-rabbim;
<br>
Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon
<br>
Which looketh toward Damascus.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thy head upon thee is like Carmel,
<br>
And the hair of thy head like purple;
<br>
The king is held captive in the tresses thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> How fair and how pleasant art thou,
<br>
O love, for delights!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> This thy stature is like to a palm-tree,
<br>
And thy breasts to its clusters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I said, I will climb up into the palm-tree,
<br>
I will take hold of the branches thereof:
<br>
Let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine,
<br>
And the smell of thy breath like apples,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And thy mouth like the best wine,
<br>
That goeth down smoothly for my beloved,
<br>
Gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I am my beloved’s;
<br>
And his desire is toward me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field;
<br>
Let us lodge in the villages.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Let us get up early to the vineyards;
<br>
Let us see whether the vine hath budded,
<br>
And its blossom is open,
<br>
And the pomegranates are in flower:
<br>
There will I give thee my love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The mandrakes give forth fragrance;
<br>
And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old,
<br>
Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
