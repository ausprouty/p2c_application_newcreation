<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Bear ye one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For each man shall bear his own burden.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Be not deceived; Elokim is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the Tree of al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But far be it from me to glory, save in the Tree of Adoneinu [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], through which the world hath been put to death hanged on a Tree unto me, and I unto the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The grace of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
