<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now all the publicans and sinners were drawing near unto him to hear him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he spoke unto them this parable, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after that which is lost, until he find it? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and his neighbors, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I say unto you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine righteous persons, who need no repentance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Or what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one piece, doth not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And when she hath found it, she calleth together her friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I had lost.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Even so, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of Elokim over one sinner that repenteth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he said, A certain man had two sons: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of thy substance that falleth to me.
<br>
 And he divided unto them his living.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country; and there he wasted his substance with riotous living.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But when he came to himself he said, How many hired servants of my fatherâ€™s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish here with hunger! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> I am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he arose, and came to his father.
<br>
 But while he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight: I am no more worthy to be called thy son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But the father said to his servants, Bring forth quickly the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and bring the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and make merry: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.
<br>
 And they began to be merry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And he called to him one of the servants, and inquired what these things might be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But he was angry, and would not go in: and his father came out, and entreated him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, and I never transgressed a commandment of thine; and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> but when this thy son came, who hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou killedst for him the fatted calf.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> But it was meet to make merry and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.
