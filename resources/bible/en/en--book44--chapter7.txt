<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the high priest said, Are these things so?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he said,
<br>
Brethren and fathers, hearken: The Elokim of glory appeared unto our father Ibrahim (Abraham), when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and said unto him, Get thee out of thy land, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Then came he out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, Elokim removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: and he promised that he would give it to him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Elokim spoke on this wise, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land, and that they should bring them into bondage, and treat them ill, four hundred years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said Elokim: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Ibrahim (Abraham) begat Ishaq (Isaac), and circumcised him the eighth day; and Ishaq (Isaac) begat Ya’qub (Jacob), and Ya’qub (Jacob) the twelve patriarchs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the patriarchs, moved with jealousy against Yusuf (Joseph), sold him into Egypt: and Elokim was with him, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now there came a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But when Ya’qub (Jacob) heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent forth our fathers the first time.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And at the second time Yusuf (Joseph) was made known to his brethren; and Yusuf’s race became manifest unto Pharaoh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) sent, and called to him Ya’qub (Jacob) his father, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) went down into Egypt; and he died, himself and our fathers; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and they were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the tomb that Ibrahim (Abraham) bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But as the time of the promise drew nigh which Elokim vouchsafed unto Ibrahim (Abraham), the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> till there arose another king over Egypt, who knew not Yusuf (Joseph).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The same dealt craftily with our race, and ill-treated our fathers, that they should cast out their babes to the end they might not live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> At which season Musa was born, and was exceeding fair; and he was nourished three months in his father’s house: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Musa was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But when he was well-nigh forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, smiting the Egyptian: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> and he supposed that his brethren understood that Elokim by his hand was giving them deliverance; but they understood not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And the day following he appeared unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Wouldest thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Musa fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And when Musa saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold, there came a voice of HaAdon, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> I am the Elokim of thy fathers, the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), and of Ishaq (Isaac), and of Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
 And Musa trembled, and durst not behold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And HaAdon said unto him, Loose the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> I have surely seen the affliction of my people that is in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I am come down to deliver them: and now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> This Musa whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? him hath Elokim sent to be both a ruler and a deliverer with the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> This man led them forth, having wrought wonders and signs in Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> This is that Musa, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall Elokim raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> This is he that was in the New Creation Masjid in the wilderness with the angel that spoke to him in the mount Sinai, and with our fathers: who received living oracles to give unto us: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> to whom our fathers would not be obedient, but thrust him from them, and turned back in their hearts unto Egypt, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> saying unto Haron (Aaron), Make us Elokim that shall go before us: for as for this Musa, who led us forth out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And they made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> But Elokim turned, and gave them up to serve the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets,
<br>
Did ye offer unto me slain beasts and sacrifices
<br>
Forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch,
<br>
And the star of the Elokim Rephan,
<br>
The figures which ye made to worship them:
<br>
And I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, even as he appointed who spoke unto Musa, that he should make it according to the figure that he had seen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua when they entered on the possession of the nations, that Elokim thrust out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David (Dawad); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> who found favor in the sight of Elokim, and asked to find a habitation for the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> But Solomon built him a house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> Howbeit the Most High dwelleth not in houses made with hands; as saith the prophet,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> The heaven is my throne,
<br>
And the earth the footstool of my feet:
<br>
What manner of house will ye build me? saith HaAdon:
<br>
Or what is the place of my rest?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> Did not my hand make all these things?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ruach: as your fathers did, so do ye.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> Which of the prophets did not your fathers persecute? and they killed them that showed before of the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have now become betrayers and murderers; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> ye who received the law as it was ordained by angels, and kept it not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> But he, being full of the Holy Ruach, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of Elokim, and [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]standing on the right hand of Elokim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Bar Enosh standing on the right hand of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and rushed upon him with one accord; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> and they cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> And they stoned Stephen, calling upon HaAdon, and saying, Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], receive my spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.
<br>
 And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
