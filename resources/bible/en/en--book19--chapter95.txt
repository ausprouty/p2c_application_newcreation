<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Oh come, let us sing unto تتراجراماتون;
<br>
Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving;
<br>
Let us make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For تتراجراماتون is a great Elokim,
<br>
And a great King above all Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> In his hand are the deep places of the earth;
<br>
The heights of the mountains are his also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The sea is his, and he made it;
<br>
And his hands formed the dry land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Oh come, let us worship and bow down;
<br>
Let us kneel before تتراجراماتون our Maker:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For he is our Elokim,
<br>
And we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
<br>
To-day, oh that ye would hear his voice!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Harden not your heart, as at Meribah,
<br>
As in the day of Massah in the wilderness;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> When your fathers tempted me,
<br>
Proved me, and saw my work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Forty years long was I grieved with that generation,
<br>
And said, It is a people that do err in their heart,
<br>
And they have not known my ways:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Wherefore I sware in my wrath,
<br>
That they should not enter into my rest.
