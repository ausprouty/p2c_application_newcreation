<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of تتراجراماتون unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> تتراجراماتون was sore displeased with your fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: Return unto me, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, and I will return unto you, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets cried, saying, Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, Return ye now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor hearken unto me, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? and they turned and said, Like as تتراجراماتون of hosts thought to do unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so hath he dealt with us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of تتراجراماتون unto Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I saw in the night, and, behold, a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were horses, red, sorrel, and white.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee what these are.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and said, These are they whom تتراجراماتون hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And they answered the angel of تتراجراماتون that stood among the myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Then the angel of تتراجراماتون answered and said, O تتراجراماتون of hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And تتراجراماتون answered the angel that talked with me with good words, even comfortable words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> So the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And I am very sore displeased with the nations that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Therefore thus saith تتراجراماتون: I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies; my house shall be built in it, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth over Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Cry yet again, saying, Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: My cities shall yet overflow with prosperity; and تتراجراماتون shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And تتراجراماتون showed me four smiths.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head; but these are come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations, which lifted up their horn against the land of Judah to scatter it.
