<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Ayyub (Job) again took up his parable, and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> As Elokim liveth, who hath taken away my right,
<br>
And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> (For my life is yet whole in me,
<br>
And the spirit of Elokim is in my nostrils);
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness,
<br>
Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Far be it from me that I should justify you:
<br>
Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go:
<br>
My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Let mine enemy be as the wicked,
<br>
And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For what is the hope of the Godless, though he get him gain,
<br>
When Elokim taketh away his soul?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Will Elokim hear his cry,
<br>
When trouble cometh upon him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Will he delight himself in the Almighty,
<br>
And call upon Elokim at all times?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I will teach you concerning the hand of Elokim;
<br>
That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it;
<br>
Why then are ye become altogether vain?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man with Elokim,
<br>
And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty<sup class="versenum">
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword;
<br>
And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Those that remain of him shall be buried in death,
<br>
And his widows shall make no lamentation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Though he heap up silver as the dust,
<br>
And prepare raiment as the clay;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on,
<br>
And the innocent shall divide the silver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He buildeth his house as the moth,
<br>
And as a booth which the keeper maketh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered to his fathers;
<br>
He openeth his eyes, and he is not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Terrors overtake him like waters;
<br>
A tempest stealeth him away in the night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth;
<br>
And it sweepeth him out of his place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For Elokim shall hurl at him, and not spare:
<br>
He would fain flee out of his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Men shall clap their hands at him,
<br>
And shall hiss him out of his place.
