<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For that the leaders took the lead in Israel,
<br>
For that the people offered themselves willingly,
<br>
Bless ye تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes;
<br>
I, even I, will sing unto تتراجراماتون;
<br>
I will sing praise to تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> تتراجراماتون, when thou wentest forth out of Seir,
<br>
When thou marchedst out of the field of Edom,
<br>
The earth trembled, the heavens also dropped,
<br>
Yea, the clouds dropped water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The mountains quaked at the presence of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Even yon Sinai at the presence of تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,
<br>
In the days of Jael, the highways were unoccupied,
<br>
And the travellers walked through byways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The rulers ceased in Israel, they ceased,
<br>
Until that I Deborah arose,
<br>
That I arose a mother in Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> They chose new Elokim;
<br>
Then was war in the gates:
<br>
Was there a shield or spear seen
<br>
Among forty thousand in Israel?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> My heart is toward the governors of Israel,
<br>
That offered themselves willingly among the people:
<br>
Bless ye تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Tell of it, ye that ride on white asses,
<br>
Ye that sit on rich carpets,
<br>
And ye that walk by the way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing water,
<br>
There shall they rehearse the righteous acts of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Even the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.
<br>
Then the people of تتراجراماتون went down to the gates.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Awake, awake, Deborah;
<br>
Awake, awake, utter a song:
<br>
Arise, Barak, and lead away thy captives, thou son of Abinoam.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then came down a remnant of the nobles and the people;
<br>
تتراجراماتون came down for me against the mighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Out of Ephraim came down they whose root is in Amalek;
<br>
After thee, Benjamin, among thy peoples;
<br>
Out of Machir came down governors,
<br>
And out of Zebulun they that handle the marshal’s staff.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah;
<br>
As was Issachar, so was Barak;
<br>
Into the valley they rushed forth at his feet.
<br>
By the watercourses of Reuben
<br>
There were great resolves of heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Why sattest thou among the sheepfolds,
<br>
To hear the pipings for the flocks?
<br>
At the watercourses of Reuben
<br>
There were great searchings of heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Gilead abode beyond the Jordan:
<br>
And Dan, why did he remain in ships?
<br>
Asher sat still at the haven of the sea,
<br>
And abode by his creeks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Zebulun was a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death,
<br>
And Naphtali, upon the high places of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The kings came and fought;
<br>
Then fought the kings of Canaan,
<br>
In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo:
<br>
They took no gain of money.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> From heaven fought the stars,
<br>
From their courses they fought against Sisera.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The river Kishon swept them away,
<br>
That ancient river, the river Kishon.
<br>
O my soul, march on with strength.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Then did the horsehoofs stamp
<br>
By reason of the prancings, the prancings of their strong ones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
Curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof,
<br>
Because they came not to the help of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
To the help of تتراجراماتون against the mighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Blessed above women shall Jael be,
<br>
The wife of Heber the Kenite;
<br>
Blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> He asked water, and she gave him milk;
<br>
She brought him butter in a lordly dish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> She put her hand to the tent-pin,
<br>
And her right hand to the workmen’s hammer;
<br>
And with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote through his head;
<br>
Yea, she pierced and struck through his temples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay;
<br>
At her feet he bowed, he fell:
<br>
Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Through the window she looked forth, and cried,
<br>
The mother of Sisera cried through the lattice,
<br>
Why is his chariot so long in coming?
<br>
Why tarry the wheels of his chariots?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Her wise ladies answered her,
<br>
Yea, she returned answer to herself,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?
<br>
A damsel, two damsels to every man;
<br>
To Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,
<br>
A spoil of dyed garments embroidered,
<br>
Of dyed garments embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> So let all thine enemies perish, O تتراجراماتون:
<br>
But let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might.
<br>
And the land had rest forty years.
