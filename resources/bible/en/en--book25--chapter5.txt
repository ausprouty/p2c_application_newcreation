<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Remember, O تتراجراماتون, what is come upon us:
<br>
Behold, and see our reproach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Our inheritance is turned unto strangers,
<br>
Our houses unto aliens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> We are orphans and fatherless;
<br>
Our mothers are as widows.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> We have drunken our water for money;
<br>
Our wood is sold unto us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Our pursuers are upon our necks:
<br>
We are weary, and have no rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> We have given the hand to the Egyptians,
<br>
And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Our fathers sinned, and are not;
<br>
And we have borne their iniquities.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Servants rule over us:
<br>
There is none to deliver us out of their hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> We get our bread at the peril of our lives,
<br>
Because of the sword of the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Our skin is black like an oven,
<br>
Because of the burning heat of famine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> They ravished the women in Zion,
<br>
The virgins in the cities of Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Princes were hanged up by their hand:
<br>
The faces of elders were not honored.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The young men bare the mill;
<br>
And the children stumbled under the wood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The elders have ceased from the gate,
<br>
The young men from their music.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The joy of our heart is ceased;
<br>
Our dance is turned into mourning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The crown is fallen from our head:
<br>
Woe unto us! for we have sinned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For this our heart is faint;
<br>
For these things our eyes are dim;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate:
<br>
The foxes walk upon it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thou, O تتراجراماتون, abidest for ever;
<br>
Thy throne is from generation to generation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,
<br>
And forsake us so long time?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Turn thou us unto 
<br>
thee, O تتراجراماتون, and we shall be turned;
<br>
Renew our days as of old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But thou hast utterly rejected us;
<br>
Thou art very wroth against us.
