<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Psalm of Dawad) تتراجراماتون, I have called upon thee; make haste unto me: Give ear unto my voice, when I call unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Let my prayer be set forth as incense before thee;
<br>
The lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Set a watch, O تتراجراماتون, before my mouth;
<br>
Keep the door of my lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Incline not my heart to any evil thing,
<br>
To practise deeds of wickedness
<br>
With men that work iniquity:
<br>
And let me not eat of their dainties.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Let the righteous smite me, it shall be a kindness;
<br>
And let him reprove me, it shall be as oil upon the head;
<br>
Let not my head refuse it:
<br>
For even in their wickedness shall my prayer continue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock;
<br>
And they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> As when one ploweth and cleaveth the earth,
<br>
Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For mine eyes are unto thee, O تتراجراماتون HaAdon:
<br>
In thee do I take refuge; leave not my soul destitute.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,
<br>
And from the gins of the workers of iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
<br>
Whilst that I withal escape.
