<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the chief priests accused him of many things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And they cried out again, Pierce alive on the Tree [T.N. See 2 Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid (Son of David) hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a Mevaser (2 Timothy 4:5) Announcer of Good News of al-Salaam to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5] him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Pierce alive on the Tree [T.N. See 2 Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid (Son of David) hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a mevaser (2 Timothy 4:5) announcer of Good News of al-Salaam to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5] him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], when he had scourged him, to be pierced alive on the Tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments.
<br>
 And they lead him out to Pierce alive on the Tree  him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his Tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And they pierce alive on the Tree  him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And it was the third hour, and they pierced alive on the Tree [T.N. See 2 Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid (Son of David) hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a mevaser (2 Timothy 4:5) announcer of Good News of al-Salaam to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5] him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And with him they pierced alive on a tree two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And the Scripture was fulfilled, With lawless men he was numbered [T.N. See Isaiah 53:12]. 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> save thyself, and come down from the Tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> In like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Let al-Masih, the King of Israel, now come down from the Tree, that we may see and believe.
<br>
 And they that were pierced alive on a Tree with him reproached him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And at the ninth hour [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My Elokim, my Elokim, why hast thou forsaken me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth IIyas (Elijah).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether IIyas (Elijah) cometh to take him down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> there came Yosef of Arimathea, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of Elokim; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Yosef.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
