<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all meekness toward all men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For we also once were foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But when the kindness of Elokim our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> not by works done in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ruach, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> which he poured out upon us richly, through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] our Saviour; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I desire that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they who have believed Elokim may be careful to maintain good works.
<br>
 These things are good and profitable unto men: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> All that are with me salute thee.
<br>
 Salute them that love us in faith.
<br>
Grace be with you all.
