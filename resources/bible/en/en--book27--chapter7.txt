<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of heaven brake forth upon the great sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made to stand upon two feet as a man; and a man’s heart was given to it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And, behold, another beast, a second, like to a bear; and it was raised up on one side, and three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth: and they said thus unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> After this I beheld, and, lo, another, like a leopard, which had upon its back four wings of a bird; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> After this I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, a fourth beast, terrible and powerful, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another horn, a little one, before which three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I beheld till thrones were placed, and one that was Atik Yomin did sit: his raiment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and the wheels thereof burning fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousands of thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I beheld at that time because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke; I beheld even till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and it was given to be burned with fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And as for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I saw in the night-visions, and, behold, there came with the clouds of heaven one like unto Bar Enosh, and he came even to the Atik Yomin, and they brought him near before him. [T.N. The Bar Enosh has authority to forgive and heal, Mark 2:10; see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; compare the word for "serve" used in both Daniel 3:12 and <sup class="versenum">13-14 which, because it means to "serve as deity" established the deity of the Bar Enosh eternal Word; only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all the peoples, nations, and languages should serve [T.N. "serve as deity"; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol; rather he is divine and not a mere man] him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> As for me, Daniel, my spirit was grieved in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth concerning all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, that shall arise out of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Then I desired to know the truth concerning the fourth beast, which was diverse from all of them, exceeding terrible, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured, brake in pieces, and stamped the residue with its feet; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and concerning the ten horns that were on its head, and the other horn which came up, and before which three fell, even that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke great things, whose look was more stout than its fellows.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> until the Atik Yomin came, and judgment was given to the saints of the Most High, and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth kingdom upon earth, which shall be diverse from all the kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And as for the ten horns, out of this kingdom shall ten kings arise: and another shall arise after them; and he shall be diverse from the former, and he shall put down three kings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And he shall speak words against the Most High, and shall wear out the saints of the Most High; and he shall think to change the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and half a time.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> But the judgment shall be set, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And the kingdom and the dominion, and the greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the Most High: his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Here is the end of the matter.
<br>
 As for me, Daniel, my thoughts much troubled me, and my countenance was changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.
