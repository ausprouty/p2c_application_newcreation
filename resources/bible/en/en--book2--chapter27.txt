<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> In the tent of meeting, without the veil which is before the testimony, Haron (Aaron) and his sons shall keep it in order from evening to morning before تتراجراماتون: it shall be a statute for ever throughout their generations on the behalf of the children of Israel.
