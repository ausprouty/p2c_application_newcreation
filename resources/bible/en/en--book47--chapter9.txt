<sup class="versenum">1</sup> For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> for I know your readiness, of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia, that Achaia hath been prepared for a year past; and your zeal hath stirred up very many of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But I have sent the brethren, that our glorying on your behalf may not be made void in this respect; that, even as I said, ye may be prepared: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> lest by any means, if there come with me any of Macedonia and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be put to shame in this confidence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I thought it necessary therefore to entreat the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your aforepromised bounty, that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty, and not of extortion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But this I say, He that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Let each man do according as he hath purposed in his heart: not grudgingly, or of necessity: for Elokim loveth a cheerful giver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Elokim is able to make all grace abound unto you; that ye, having always all sufficiency in everything, may abound unto every good work: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> as it is written,
<br>
He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor;
<br>
His righteousness abideth for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he that supplieth seed to the sower and bread for food, shall supply and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> ye being enriched in everything unto all liberality, which worketh through us thanksgiving to Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For the ministration of this service not only filleth up the measure of the wants of the saints, but aboundeth also through many thanksgivings unto Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> seeing that through the proving of you by this ministration they glorify Elokim for the obedience of your confession unto the Holy Injil of Al-Masih, and for the liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> while they themselves also, with supplication on your behalf, long after you by reason of the exceeding grace of Elokim in you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thanks be to Elokim for his unspeakable gift.
