<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Psalm of Dawad) تتراجراماتون, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle?
<br>
Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness,
<br>
And speaketh truth in his heart;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> He that slandereth not with his tongue,
<br>
Nor doeth evil to his friend,
<br>
Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> In whose eyes a reprobate is despised,
<br>
But who honoreth them that fear تتراجراماتون;
<br>
He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> He that putteth not out his money to interest,
<br>
Nor taketh reward against the innocent.
<br>
He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
