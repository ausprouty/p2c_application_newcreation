<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And it was that Mary who anointed HaAdon with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of Elokim, that the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] may be glorified thereby.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Now [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> These things spoke he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Now [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spoke of taking rest in sleep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Then [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> So when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Martha therefore, when she heard that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Martha therefore said unto [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of Elokim, Elokim will give thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die.
<br>
 Believest thou this? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art al-Masih, the Son of Elokim, even he that cometh into the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> (Now [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Mary therefore, when she came where [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> When [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]wept.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb.
<br>
 Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith, Take ye away the stone.
<br>
 Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been dead four days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of Elokim? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> So they took away the stone.
<br>
 And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin.
<br>
 [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]had done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> Now this he said not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]should die for the nation; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of Elokim that are scattered abroad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> They sought therefore for [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and spoke one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.
