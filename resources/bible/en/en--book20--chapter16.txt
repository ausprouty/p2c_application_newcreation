<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The plans of the heart belong to man;
<br>
But the answer of the tongue is from تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes;
<br>
But تتراجراماتون weigheth the spirits.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Commit thy works unto تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And thy purposes shall be established.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> تتراجراماتون hath made everything for its own end;
<br>
Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to تتراجراماتون:
<br>
Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for;
<br>
And by the fear of تتراجراماتون men depart from evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> When a man’s ways please تتراجراماتون,
<br>
He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Better is a little, with righteousness,
<br>
Than great revenues with injustice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> A man’s heart deviseth his way;
<br>
But تتراجراماتون directeth his steps.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> A divine sentence is in the lips of the king;
<br>
His mouth shall not transgress in judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> A just balance and scales are تتراجراماتون’s;
<br>
All the weights of the bag are his work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness;
<br>
For the throne is established by righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Righteous lips are the delight of kings;
<br>
And they love him that speaketh right.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The wrath of a king is as messengers of death;
<br>
But a wise man will pacify it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> In the light of the king’s countenance is life;
<br>
And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> How much better is it to get [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] wisdom than gold!
<br>
Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The highway of the upright is to depart from evil:
<br>
He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Pride goeth before destruction,
<br>
And a haughty spirit before a fall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor,
<br>
Than to divide the spoil with the proud.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good;
<br>
And whoso trusteth in تتراجراماتون, happy is he.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The wise in heart shall be called prudent;
<br>
And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it;
<br>
But the correction of fools is their folly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth,
<br>
And addeth learning to his lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Pleasant words are as a honeycomb,
<br>
Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> There is a way which seemeth right unto a man,
<br>
But the end thereof are the ways of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> The appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him;
<br>
For his mouth urgeth him thereto.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> A worthless man deviseth mischief;
<br>
And in his lips there is as a scorching fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> A perverse man scattereth abroad strife;
<br>
And a whisperer separateth chief friends.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> A man of violence enticeth his neighbor,
<br>
And leadeth him in a way that is not good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise perverse things:
<br>
He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> The hoary head is a crown of glory;
<br>
It shall be found in the way of righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty;
<br>
And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> The lot is cast into the lap;
<br>
But the whole disposing thereof is of تتراجراماتون.
