<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now after two days was the feast of the passover and the unleavened bread: and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him with subtlety, and kill him:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> for they said, Not during the feast, lest haply there shall be a tumult of the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And while he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster cruse of ointment of pure nard very costly; and she brake the cruse, and poured it over his head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But there were some that had indignation among themselves, saying, To what purpose hath this waste of the ointment been made? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For this ointment might have been sold for above three hundred shillings, and given to the poor.
<br>
 And they murmured against her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? she hath wrought a good work on me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For ye have the poor always with you, and whensoever ye will ye can do them good: but me ye have not always.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> She hath done what she could; she hath anointed my body beforehand for the burying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And verily I say unto you, Wheresoever the Holy Injil shall be preached throughout the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Judas Iscariot, he that was one of the twelve, went away unto the chief priests, that he might deliver him unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And they, when they heard it, were glad, and promised to give him money.
<br>
 And he sought how he might conveniently deliver him unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And on the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover [T.N.This verse reminds us of  the Exodus and the Passover and Isa the Qurbani Lamb of Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29 and John 19:14-16 and the fact that Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation.], his disciples say unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and make ready that thou mayest eat the passover? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith unto them, Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water: follow him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and wheresoever he shall enter in, say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith, Where is my guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he will himself show you a large upper room furnished and ready: and there make ready for us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the disciples went forth, and came into the city, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And when it was evening he cometh with the twelve.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And as they sat and were eating, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said, Verily I say unto you, One of you shall betray me, even he that eateth with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> They began to be sorrowful, and to say unto him one by one, Is it I? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he said unto them, It is one of the twelve, he that dippeth with me in the dish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For the Bar Enosh goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Bar Enosh is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And as they were eating, he took bread, and when he had blessed, he brake it, and gave to them, and said, Take ye: this is my body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave to them: and they all drank of it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And he said unto them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Verily I say unto you, I shall no more drink of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And when they had sung a hymn, they went out unto the mount of Olives.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, All ye shall be offended: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Howbeit, after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But Peter said unto him, Although all shall be offended, yet will not I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that thou to-day, even this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt deny me thrice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> But he spoke exceeding vehemently, If I must die with thee, I will not deny thee.
<br>
 And in like manner also said they all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And they come unto a place which was named Gethsemane: and he saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I pray.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And he taketh with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly amazed, and sore troubled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And he saith unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death: abide ye here, and watch.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And he went forward a little, and fell on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass away from him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; remove this cup from me: howbeit not what I will, but what thou wilt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? couldest thou not watch one hour? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And again he went away, and prayed, saying the same words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And again he came, and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they knew not what to answer him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And he cometh the third time, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: it is enough; the hour is come; behold, the Bar Enosh is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> Arise, let us be going: behold, he that betrayeth me is at hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And straightway, while he yet spoke, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Now he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; take him, and lead him away safely.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And when he was come, straightway he came to him, and saith, Rabbi; and kissed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And they laid hands on him, and took him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> But a certain one of them that stood by drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves to seize me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not: but this is done that the scriptures might be fulfilled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And they all left him, and fled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And a certain young man followed with him, having a linen cloth cast about him, over his naked body: and they lay hold on him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> but he left the linen cloth, and fled naked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> And they led [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]away to the high priest: and there come together with him all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> And Peter had followed him afar off, even within, into the court of the high priest; and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself in the light of the fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witness against [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]to put him to death; and found it not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> For many bare false witness against him, and their witness agreed not together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> And there stood up certain, and bare false witness against him, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> And not even so did their witness agree together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], saying, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">61</sup> But he held his peace, and answered nothing.
<br>
 Again the high priest asked him, and saith unto him, Art thou al-Masih, the [Bar Enosh] Son of the [Atik Yomin] Blessed? [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">62</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said, I am: and ye shall see the Bar Enosh sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">63</sup> And the high priest rent his clothes, and saith, What further need have we of witnesses? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">64</sup> Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be worthy of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">65</sup> And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him, Prophesy: and the officers received him with blows of their hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">66</sup> And as Peter was beneath in the court, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">67</sup> and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked upon him, and saith, Thou also wast with the Nazarene, even [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">68</sup> But he denied, saying, I neither know, nor understand what thou sayest: and he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">69</sup> And the maid saw him, and began again to say to them that stood by, This is one of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">70</sup> But he again denied it.
<br>
 And after a little while again they that stood by said to Peter, Of a truth thou art one of them; for thou art a Galilean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">71</sup> But he began to curse, and to swear, I know not this man of whom ye speak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">72</sup> And straightway the second time the cock crew.
<br>
 And Peter called to mind the word, how that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.
<br>
 And when he thought thereon, he wept.
