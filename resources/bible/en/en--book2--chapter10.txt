<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Go in unto Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show these my signs in the midst of them,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what things I have wrought upon Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know that I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) went in unto Pharaoh, and said unto him, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may serve me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Else, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring locusts into thy border:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and they shall cover the face of the earth, so that one shall not be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remaineth unto you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; as neither thy fathers nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day.
<br>
 And he turned, and went out from Pharaoh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Pharaoh’s servants said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? let the men go, that they may serve تتراجراماتون their Elokim: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he said unto them, Go, serve تتراجراماتون your Elokim; but who are they that shall go?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Musa said, We will go with our young and with our old; with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he said unto them, So be تتراجراماتون with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve تتراجراماتون; for that is what ye desire. And they were driven out from Pharaoh’s presence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Musa stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and تتراجراماتون brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt; very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing, either tree or herb of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Then Pharaoh called for Musa and Haron (Aaron) in haste; and he said, I have sinned against تتراجراماتون your Elokim, and against you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat تتراجراماتون your Elokim, that he may take away from me this death only.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And تتراجراماتون turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea; there remained not one locust in all the border of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But تتراجراماتون hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Stretch out thy hand toward heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Musa stretched forth his hand toward heaven; and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> they saw not one another, neither rose any one from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Pharaoh called unto Musa, and said, Go ye, serve تتراجراماتون; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And Musa said, Thou must also give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice unto تتراجراماتون our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind: for thereof must we take to serve تتراجراماتون our Elokim; and we know not with what we must serve تتراجراماتون, until we come thither.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But تتراجراماتون hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let them go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Pharaoh said unto him, Get thee from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face thou shalt die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Musa said, Thou hast spoken well.
<br>
 I will see thy face again no more.
