<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now Musa was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of Elokim, unto Horeb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Musa said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And when تتراجراماتون saw that he turned aside to see, Elokim called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Musa, Musa.
<br>
 And he said, Here am I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he said, Draw not nigh hither: put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Moreover he said, I am the Elokim of thy father, the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), the Elokim of Ishaq (Isaac), and the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
 And Musa hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And تتراجراماتون said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: moreover I have seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Musa said unto Elokim, Who am I, that I should go unto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be the token unto thee, that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve Elokim upon this mountain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Musa said unto Elokim, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The Elokim of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Elokim said unto Musa, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Elokim said moreover unto Musa, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of your fathers, the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), the Elokim of Ishaq (Isaac), and the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob), hath sent me unto you: this is my name forever, and this is my memorial unto all generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto them, تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of your fathers, the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), of Ishaq (Isaac), and of Ya’qub (Jacob), hath appeared unto me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of the Hebrews, hath met with us: and now let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to تتراجراماتون our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.
