<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And after six days [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]taketh with him Peter, and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and he was transfigured before them; and his face did shine as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And behold, there appeared unto them Musa and IIyas (Elijah) talking with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Peter answered, and said unto [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, I will make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Musa, and one for IIyas (Elijah).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]came and touched them and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, save [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]only.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And as they were coming down from the mountain, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Bar Enosh be risen from the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes that IIyas (Elijah) must first come? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he answered and said, IIyas (Elijah) indeed cometh, and shall restore all things: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> but I say unto you, that IIyas (Elijah) is come already, and they knew him not, but did unto him whatsoever they would. Even so shall the Bar Enosh also suffer of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then understood the disciples that he spoke unto them of Yahya the Immerser.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a man, kneeling to him, and saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is epileptic, and suffereth grievously; for oft-times he falleth into the fire, and oft-times into the water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him hither to me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]rebuked him; and the demon went out of him: and the boy was cured from that hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Then came the disciples to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]apart, and said, Why could not we cast it out? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he saith unto them, Because of your little faith: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> *
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And while they abode in Galilee, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, The Bar Enosh shall be delivered up into the hands of men; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised up.
<br>
 And they were exceeding sorry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received the half-shekel came to Peter, and said, Doth not your teacher pay the half-shekel? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> He saith, Yea.
<br>
 And when he came into the house, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]spoke first to him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? the kings of the earth, from whom do they receive toll or tribute? from their sons, or from strangers? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And when he said, From strangers, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Therefore the sons are free.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But, lest we cause them to stumble, go thou to the sea, and cast a hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a shekel: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.
