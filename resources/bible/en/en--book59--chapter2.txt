<sup class="versenum">1</sup> My brethren, hold not the faith of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], HaAdon of glory, with respect of persons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For if there come into your synagogue a man with a gold ring, in fine clothing, and there come in also a poor man in vile clothing;  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and ye have regard to him that weareth the fine clothing, and say, Sit thou here in a good place; and ye say to the poor man, Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool;  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> do ye not make distinctions among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Hearken, my beloved brethren; did not Elokim choose them that are poor as to the world to be rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him?  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But ye have dishonored the poor man.
<br>
 Do not the rich oppress you, and themselves drag you before the judgment-seats?  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Do not they blaspheme the honorable name by which ye are called?  <sup class="versenum">8</sup> Howbeit if ye fulfil the royal law, according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> but if ye have respect of persons, ye commit sin, being convicted by the law as transgressors.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou dost not commit adultery, but killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So speak ye, and so do, as men that are to be judged by a law of liberty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For judgment is without mercy to him that hath showed no mercy: mercy glorieth against judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> What doth it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but have not works? can that faith save him?  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> If a brother or sister be naked and in lack of daily food, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and one of you say unto them, Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; and yet ye give them not the things needful to the body; what doth it profit?  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Even so faith, if it have not works, is dead in itself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Yea, a man will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith apart from thy works, and I by my works will show thee my faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thou believest that Elokim is one; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and shudder.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith apart from works is barren?  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Was not Ibrahim (Abraham) our father justified by works, in that he offered up Ishaq (Isaac) his son upon the altar?  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Thou seest that faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect;  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and the scripture was fulfilled which saith, And Ibrahim (Abraham) believed Elokim, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness; and he was called the friend of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Ye see that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And in like manner was not also Rahab the harlot justified by works, in that she received the messengers, and sent them out another way?  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, even so faith apart from works is dead.
