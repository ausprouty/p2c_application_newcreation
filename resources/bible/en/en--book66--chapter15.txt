<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having seven plagues, which are the last, for in them is finished the wrath of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire; and them that come off victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass, having harps of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And they sing the song of Musa the servant of Elokim, and the song of the Lamb, saying,
<br>
Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord Elokim, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with precious stone, pure and bright, and girt about their chests with golden girdles.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of Elokim, who liveth for ever and ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of Elokim, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.
