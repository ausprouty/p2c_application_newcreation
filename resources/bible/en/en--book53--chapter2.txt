<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now we beseech you, brethren, touching the coming of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], and our gathering together unto him;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> to the end that ye be not quickly shaken from your mind, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of HaAdon is just at hand; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> let no man beguile you in any wise: for it will not be, except the falling away come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> he that opposeth and exalteth himself against all that is called Elokim or that is worshipped; so that he sitteth in the temple of Elokim, setting himself forth as Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And now ye know that which restraineth, to the end that he may be revealed in his own season.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For the mystery of lawlessness doth already work: only there is one that restraineth now, until he be taken out of the way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And then shall be revealed the lawless one, whom HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]shall slay with the breath of his mouth, and bring to nought by the manifestation of his coming; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> even he, whose coming is according to the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and with all deceit of unrighteousness for them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And for this cause Elokim sendeth them a working of error, that they should believe a lie: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But we are bound to give thanks to Elokim always for you, brethren beloved of HaAdon, for that Elokim chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> whereunto he called you through our Holy Injil, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So then, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye were taught, whether by word, or by epistle of ours.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Now our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] himself, and Elokim our Father who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.
