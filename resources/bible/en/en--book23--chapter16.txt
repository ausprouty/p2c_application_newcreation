<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land from Selah to the wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For it shall be that, as wandering birds, as a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Give counsel, execute justice; make thy shade as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Let mine outcasts dwell with thee; as for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the destroyer.
<br>
 For the extortioner is brought to nought, destruction ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And a throne shall be established in lovingkindness; and one shall sit thereon in truth, in the tent of David (Dawad), judging, and seeking justice, and swift to do righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; even of his arrogancy, and his pride, and his wrath; his boastings are nought.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail: for the raisin-cakes of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn, utterly stricken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down the choice branches thereof, which reached even unto Jazer, which wandered into the wilderness; its shoots were spread abroad, they passed over the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh: for upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest the battle shout is fallen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither joyful noise: no treader shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the vintage shout to cease.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Wherefore my heart soundeth like a harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kir-heres.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And it shall come to pass, when Moab presenteth himself, when he wearieth himself upon the high place, and shall come to his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> This is the word that تتراجراماتون spoke concerning Moab in time past.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But now تتراجراماتون hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as the years of a hireling, the glory of Moab shall be brought into contempt, with all his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and of no account.
