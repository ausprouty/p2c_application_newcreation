<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, an apostle of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]through the will of Elokim, to the saints [T.N. saints are Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God who bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation] that are at Ephesus, and the faithful in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Grace to you and peace from Elokim our Father and HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Blessed be the Elokim and Father of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Al-Masih: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> making known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Al-Masih, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, I say, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Al-Masih: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the Holy Injil of your salvation,’in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Ruach of promise, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of Elokim’s own possession, unto the praise of his glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]which is among you, and the love which ye show toward all the saints, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> that the Elokim of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> which he wrought in Al-Masih, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the New Creation Masjid, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
