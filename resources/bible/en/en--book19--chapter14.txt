<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (For the Chief Musician.
<br>
 A Psalm of Dawad) The fool hath said in his heart, There is no Elokim.
<br>
They are corrupt, they have done abominable works;
<br>
There is none that doeth good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> تتراجراماتون looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
<br>
To see if there were any that did understand,
<br>
That did seek after Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy;
<br>
There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge,
<br>
Who eat up my people as they eat bread,
<br>
And call not upon تتراجراماتون?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> There were they in great fear;
<br>
For Elokim is in the generation of the righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor,
<br>
Because تتراجراماتون is his refuge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
<br>
When تتراجراماتون bringeth back the captivity of his people,
<br>
Then shall Ya’qub (Jacob) rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
