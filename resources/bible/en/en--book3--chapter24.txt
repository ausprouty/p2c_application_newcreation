<sup class="versenum">1</sup>And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Haron (Aaron) keep it in order from evening to morning before تتراجراماتون continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before تتراجراماتون continually.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before تتراجراماتون continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And it shall be for Haron (Aaron) and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of تتراجراماتون made by fire by a perpetual statute.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Musa. And his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his Elokim shall bear his sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he that blasphemeth the name of تتراجراماتون, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name of تتراجراماتون, shall be put to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Musa spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
