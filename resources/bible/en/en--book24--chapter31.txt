<sup class="versenum">1</sup> At that time, saith تتراجراماتون, will I be the Elokim of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون, The people that were left of the sword found favor in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> تتراجراماتون appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Again will I build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: again shalt thou be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Again shalt thou plant vineyards upon the mountains of Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall enjoy the fruit thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto تتراجراماتون our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون, Sing with gladness for Ya’qub (Jacob), and shout for the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O تتراجراماتون, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the uttermost parts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall they return hither.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> They shall come with weeping; and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by rivers of waters, in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble; for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Hear the word of تتراجراماتون, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off; and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For تتراجراماتون hath ransomed Ya’qub (Jacob), and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and shall flow unto the goodness of تتراجراماتون, to the grain, and to the new wine, and to the oil, and to the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for her children; she refuseth to be comforted for her children, because they are not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears; for thy work shall be rewarded, saith تتراجراماتون; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And there is hope for thy latter end, saith تتراجراماتون; and thy children shall come again to their own border.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a calf unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art تتراجراماتون my Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my heart yearneth for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Set thee up waymarks, make thee guide-posts; set thy heart toward the highway, even the way by which thou wentest: turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> How long wilt thou go hither and thither, O thou backsliding daughter? for تتراجراماتون hath created a new thing in the earth: a woman shall encompass a man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel, Yet again shall they use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity: تتراجراماتون bless thee, O habitation of righteousness, O mountain of holiness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Judah and all the cities thereof shall dwell therein together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul have I replenished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Behold, the days come, saith تتراجراماتون, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And it shall come to pass that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them to build and to plant, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Behold, the days come, saith تتراجراماتون, that I will make a new covenant [T.N. See Genesis 17:2; Exodus 12:13; Isaiah 53:7; Luke 22:20; Colossians 2:16-23] with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was a husband unto them, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith تتراجراماتون: I will put my law in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it; and I will be their Elokim, and they shall be my people. [T.N. In other words, as Dawad (David) says in Psalm 51:5 he was a sinner from conception. See Psalm 58:3.  He refers to hereditary corruption which necessitates the new creation new birth (John 3:3) illuminated here in the new covenant known by all true Khalq Jadeed submitters to تتراجراماتو and especially with the new creation life of the persecutor Saul in Acts 9:1-19 being the foremost example. See 2 Kings 5:14 where it says that then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that تتراجراماتو  can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (Romans 6:3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a new covenant khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know تتراجراماتون; for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith تتراجراماتون: for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I remember no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون, who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who stirreth up the sea, so that the waves thereof roar; تتراجراماتون of hosts is his name: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> If these ordinances depart from before me, saith تتراجراماتون, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Behold, the days come, saith تتراجراماتون, that the city shall be built to تتراجراماتون from the tower of Hananel unto the gate of the corner.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And the measuring line shall go out further straight onward unto the hill Gareb, and shall turn about unto Goah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy unto تتراجراماتون; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.
