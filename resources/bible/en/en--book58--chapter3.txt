<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh];
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Musa in all his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Musa, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Musa indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> but al-Masih as Bar Enosh Heir (see Daniel 7:13-14), over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Wherefore, even as the Holy Ruach saith,
<br>
To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,
<br>
Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Where your fathers tried me by proving me,
<br>
And saw my works forty years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Wherefore I was displeased with this generation,
<br>
And said, They do always err in their heart:
<br>
But they did not know my ways;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> As I sware in my wrath,
<br>
They shall not enter into my rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> for we are become partakers of al-Masih, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> while it is said,
<br>
To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
<br>
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Musa? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.
