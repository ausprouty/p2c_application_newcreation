<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go: I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided me a king among his sons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.  And تتراجراماتون said, Take a heifer with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Samuel did that which تتراجراماتون spoke, and came to Beth-lehem.  And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said, Comest thou peaceably? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto تتراجراماتون: sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.  And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely تتراجراماتون’s anointed is before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But تتراجراماتون said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him: for تتراجراماتون seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but تتراجراماتون looketh on the heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.  And he said, Neither hath تتراجراماتون chosen this.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by.  And he said, Neither hath تتراجراماتون chosen this.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.  And Samuel said unto Jesse, تتراجراماتون hath not chosen these.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he is keeping the sheep.  And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he sent, and brought him in.  Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look upon.  And تتراجراماتون said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of تتراجراماتون came mightily upon David (Dawad) from that day forward.  So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Now the Spirit of تتراجراماتون departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from تتراجراماتون troubled him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Saul’s servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from Elokim troubleth thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp: and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from Elokim is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent in speech, and a comely person; and تتراجراماتون is with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me David (Dawad) thy son, who is with the sheep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David (Dawad) his son unto Saul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And David (Dawad) came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him greatly; and he became his armorbearer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David (Dawad), I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favor in my sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from Elokim was upon Saul, that David (Dawad) took the harp, and played with his hand: so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed from him.
