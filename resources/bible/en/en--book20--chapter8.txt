<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Doth not wisdom cry,
<br>
And understanding put forth her voice?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> On the top of high places by the way,
<br>
Where the paths meet, she standeth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Beside the gates, at the entry of the city,
<br>
At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Unto you, O men, I call;
<br>
And my voice is to the sons of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> O ye simple, understand prudence;
<br>
And, ye fools, be of an understanding heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Hear, for I will speak excellent things;
<br>
And the opening of my lips shall be right things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For my mouth shall utter truth;
<br>
And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> All the words of my mouth are in righteousness;
<br>
There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> They are all plain to him that understandeth,
<br>
And right to them that find knowledge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Receive my instruction, and not silver;
<br>
And knowledge rather than choice gold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For wisdom is better than rubies;
<br>
And all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I wisdom have made prudence my dwelling,
<br>
And find out knowledge and discretion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The fear of تتراجراماتون is to hate evil:
<br>
Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way,
<br>
And the perverse mouth, do I hate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge:
<br>
I am understanding; I have might.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> By me kings reign,
<br>
And princes decree justice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> By me princes rule,
<br>
And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> I love them that love me;
<br>
And those that seek me diligently shall find me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Riches and honor are with me;
<br>
Yea, durable wealth and righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold;
<br>
And my revenue than choice silver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> I walk in the way of righteousness,
<br>
In the midst of the paths of justice;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance,
<br>
And that I may fill their treasuries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> تتراجراماتون possessed [T.N. See this in Hebrew where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam but always existed as God’s agent, who was with God and was God, John 1:1; Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (<sup class="versenum">17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, <sup class="versenum">30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (<sup class="versenum">12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (<sup class="versenum">17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).] me in the beginning of his way,
<br>
Before his works of old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
<br>
Before the earth was.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> When there were no depths, I was brought forth,
<br>
When there were no fountains abounding with water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Before the mountains were settled,
<br>
Before the hills was I brought forth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,
<br>
Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> When he established the heavens, I was there:
<br>
When he set a circle upon the face of the deep,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> When he made firm the skies above,
<br>
When the fountains of the deep became strong,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> When he gave to the sea its bound,
<br>
That the waters should not transgress his commandment,
<br>
When he marked out the foundations of the earth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Then I was by him, as a master workman;
<br>
And I was daily his delight,
<br>
Rejoicing always before him,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Rejoicing in his habitable earth;
<br>
And my delight was with the sons of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me;
<br>
For blessed are they that keep my ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Hear instruction, and be wise,
<br>
And refuse it not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Blessed is the man that heareth me,
<br>
Watching daily at my gates,
<br>
Waiting at the posts of my doors.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> For whoso findeth me findeth life,
<br>
And shall obtain favor of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul:
<br>
All they that hate me love death.
