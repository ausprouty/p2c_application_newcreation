<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For I am jealous over you with a Godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Hawwa (Eve) in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For if he that cometh preacheth another [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], whom we did not preach, or if ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different Holy Injil, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But though I be rude in speech, yet am I not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made this manifest unto you in all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the Holy Injil of Elokim for nought? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I robbed other New Creation Masjid, taking wages of them that I might minister unto you; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> As the truth of Al-Masih is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Wherefore? because I love you not? Elokim knoweth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if ye do, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> That which I speak, I speak not after HaAdon, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you captive, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Ibrahim (Abraham)? so am I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Are they ministers of Al-Masih? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my countrymen, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> The Elokim and Father of HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.
