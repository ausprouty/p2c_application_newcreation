<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; The oracle.
<br>
The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Surely I am more brutish than any man,
<br>
And have not the understanding of a man;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And I have not learned wisdom,
<br>
Neither have I the knowledge of the Holy One.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended?
<br>
Who hath gathered the wind in his fists?
<br>
Who hath bound the waters in his garment?
<br>
Who hath established all the ends of the earth?
<br>
What is his name, and what is his Son’s [T.N. Regarding this Wisdom Sonship, the Hebrew in Proverbs 8:22 is instructive. In Proverbs 8:22 تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh, and in the work of creation and redemption (see Psalm 33:6; 107:20) from all eternity تتراجراماتون 's Eternal Word toiled at تتراجراماتون 's side like a Son toils at the side of His Father. This Bar Enosh in heaven coming to the Atik Yomin seen in Daniel 7:13-14 New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41; only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (<sup class="versenum">4), the source of revelation (<sup class="versenum">3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).] name, if thou knowest?

<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Every word of Elokim is tried:
<br>
He is a shield unto them that take refuge in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Add thou not unto his words,
<br>
Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Two things have I asked of thee;
<br>
Deny me them not before I die:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Remove far from me falsehood and lies;
<br>
Give me neither poverty nor riches;
<br>
Feed me with the food that is needful for me:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is تتراجراماتون?
<br>
Or lest I be poor, and steal,
<br>
And use profanely the name of my Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Slander not a servant unto his master,
<br>
Lest he curse thee, and thou be held guilty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> There is a generation that curse their father,
<br>
And bless not their mother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,
<br>
And yet are not washed from their filthiness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!
<br>
And their eyelids are lifted up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> There is a generation whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives,
<br>
To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give.
<br>
There are three things that are never satisfied,
<br>
Yea, four that say not, Enough:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Sheol; and the barren womb;
<br>
The earth that is not satisfied with water;
<br>
And the fire that saith not, Enough.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The eye that mocketh at his father,
<br>
And despiseth to obey his mother,
<br>
The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,
<br>
And the young eagles shall eat it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> There are three things which are too wonderful for me,
<br>
Yea, four which I know not:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The way of an eagle in the air;
<br>
The way of a serpent upon a rock;
<br>
The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;
<br>
And the way of a man with a maiden.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> So is the way of an adulterous woman;
<br>
She eateth, and wipeth her mouth,
<br>
And saith, I have done no wickedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For three things the earth doth tremble,
<br>
And for four, which it cannot bear:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For a servant when he is king;
<br>
And a fool when he is filled with food;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For an odious woman when she is married;
<br>
And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> There are four things which are little upon the earth,
<br>
But they are exceeding wise:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> The ants are a people not strong,
<br>
Yet they provide their food in the summer;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> The conies are but a feeble folk,
<br>
Yet make they their houses in the rocks;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> The locusts have no king,
<br>
Yet go they forth all of them by bands;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> The lizard taketh hold with her hands,
<br>
Yet is she in kings’ palaces.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> There are three things which are stately in their march,
<br>
Yea, four which are stately in going:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> The lion, which is mightiest among beasts,
<br>
And turneth not away for any;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> The greyhound; the he-goat also;
<br>
And the king against whom there is no rising up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,
<br>
Or if thou hast thought evil,
<br>
Lay thy hand upon thy mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> For the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,
<br>
And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood;
<br>
So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
