<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The word of تتراجراماتون which came unto Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I will utterly consume all things from off the face of the ground, saith تتراجراماتون. [T.N. See 2 Peter 3:11-12]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I will consume man and beast; I will consume the birds of the heavens, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks with the wicked; and I will cut off man from off the face of the ground, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And I will stretch out my hand upon Judah, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarim with the priests; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops; and them that worship, that swear to تتراجراماتون and swear by Malcam; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and them that are turned back from following تتراجراماتون; and those that have not sought تتراجراماتون, nor inquired after him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Hold thy peace at the presence of HaAdon تتراجراماتون; for the day of تتراجراماتون is at hand: for تتراجراماتون hath prepared a sacrifice [T.N. See Exodus 12:13 And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there shall no plague be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. Here we see from Isaiah 53:7 the blood of this Qurbani Lamb of تتراجراماتون, this Lamb Masih. We see from Exodus 12:13 the token in that verse that points to the Qurbani Lamb, this Lamb Masih in Isaiah 53:7 which constitutes the token of justification (Romans 5:9) and the Exodus 12:13 token for admission to heaven, see John 14:6; Luke 22:19], he hath consecrated his guests.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And it shall come to pass in the day of تتراجراماتون’s sacrifice, that I will punish the princes, and the king’s sons, and all such as are clothed with foreign apparel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And in that day I will punish all those that leap over the threshold, that fill their master’s house with violence and deceit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And in that day, saith تتراجراماتون, there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and a wailing from the second quarter, and a great crashing from the hills.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Wail, ye inhabitants of Maktesh; for all the people of Canaan are undone; all they that were laden with silver are cut off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps; and I will punish the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, تتراجراماتون will not do good, neither will he do evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And their wealth shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation: yea, they shall build houses, but shall not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but shall not drink the wine thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The great day of تتراجراماتون is near, it is near and hasteth greatly, even the voice of the day of تتراجراماتون; the mighty man crieth there bitterly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> a day of the trumpet and alarm, against the fortified cities, and against the high battlements.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like blind men, because they have sinned against تتراجراماتون; and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as dung.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of تتراجراماتون’s wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he will make an end, yea, a terrible end, of all them that dwell in the land.
