<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of Dawad; when the Ziphites came and said to Saul, Doth not Dawad hide himself with us?) Save me, O Elokim, by thy name,

And judge me in thy might.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hear my prayer, O Elokim;
<br>
Give ear to the words of my mouth.

<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For strangers are risen up against me,
<br>
And violent men have sought after my soul:
<br>
They have not set Elokim before them.

HaAdon is of them that uphold my soul.

Destroy thou them in thy truth.

<br>
And mine eye hath seen my desire upon mine enemies.
