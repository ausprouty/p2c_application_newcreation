<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون came up from Gilgal to Bochim.
<br>
 And he said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant with you: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; ye shall break down their altars.
<br>
 But ye have not hearkened unto my voice: why have ye done this? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their Elokim shall be a snare unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And it came to pass, when the angel of تتراجراماتون spoke these words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the people served تتراجراماتون all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of تتراجراماتون that he had wrought for Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of تتراجراماتون, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, that knew not تتراجراماتون, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون, and served the Baalim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and they forsook تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other Elokim, of the Elokim of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them: and they provoked تتراجراماتون to anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And they forsook تتراجراماتون, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the anger of تتراجراماتون was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Whithersoever they went out, the hand of تتراجراماتون was against them for evil, as تتراجراماتون had spoken, and as تتراجراماتون had sworn unto them: and they were sore distressed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And تتراجراماتون raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those that despoiled them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And yet they hearkened not unto their judges; for they played the harlot after other Elokim, and bowed themselves down unto them: they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of تتراجراماتون; but they did not so.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And when تتراجراماتون raised them up judges, then تتراجراماتون was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented تتراجراماتون because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other Elokim to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the anger of تتراجراماتون was kindled against Israel; and he said, Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of تتراجراماتون to walk therein, as their fathers did keep it, or not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> So تتراجراماتون left those nations, without driving them out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.
