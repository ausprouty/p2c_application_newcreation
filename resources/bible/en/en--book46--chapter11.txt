<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But I would have you know, that the head of every man is al-Masih; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of [Bar Enosh] al-Masih is [Atik Yomin] Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of Elokim: but the woman is the glory of the man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> for this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto Elokim unveiled? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the New Creation Masjid of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For first of all, when ye come together in the New Creation Masjid, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord's Supper [T.N.This verse reminds us of  the Exodus and the Passover and Isa the Qurbani Lamb of Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29 and John 19:14-16 and the fact that Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation.]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> for in your eating each one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the New Creation Masjid of Elokim, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For I received of HaAdon that which also I delivered unto you, that HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]in the night in which he was betrayed took bread; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim HaAdonâ€™s death till he come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of HaAdon in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> But when we are judged, we are chastened of HaAdon, that we may not be condemned with the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment.
<br>
 And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.
