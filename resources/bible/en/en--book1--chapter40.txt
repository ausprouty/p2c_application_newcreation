<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Pharaoh was wroth against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard, into the prison, the place where Yusuf (Joseph) was bound.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And the captain of the guard charged Yusuf (Joseph) with them, and he ministered unto them: and they continued a season in ward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream, in one night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) came in unto them in the morning, and saw them, and, behold, they were sad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in ward in his master’s house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sad to-day? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it. And Yusuf (Joseph) said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to Elokim? tell it me, I pray you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the chief butler told his dream to Yusuf (Joseph), and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it budded, and its blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes, and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: the three branches are three days; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head, and restore thee unto thine office: and thou shalt give Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But have me in thy remembrance when it shall be well with thee, and show kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews: and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Yusuf (Joseph), I also was in my dream, and, behold, three baskets of white bread were on my head: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked food for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: the three baskets are three days; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> within yet three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again; and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> but he hanged the chief baker: as Yusuf (Joseph) had interpreted to them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Yet did not the chief butler remember Yusuf (Joseph), but forgat him.
