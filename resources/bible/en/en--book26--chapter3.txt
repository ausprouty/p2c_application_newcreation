<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this roll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee.
<br>
 Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> not to many peoples of a strange speech and of a hard language, whose words thou canst not understand.
<br>
 Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are of hard forehead and of a stiff heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of تتراجراماتون from his place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away; and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; and the hand of تتراجراماتون was strong upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">18</sup> When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Again, when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and thou hast delivered thy soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the hand of تتراجراماتون was there upon me; and he said unto me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of تتراجراماتون stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spoke with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.
