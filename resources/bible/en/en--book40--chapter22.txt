<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and spoke again in parables unto them, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, who made a marriage feast for his son, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner; my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and the rest laid hold on his servants, and treated them shamefully, and killed them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man who had not on a wedding-garment: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For many are called, but few chosen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in his talk.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of Elokim in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]perceived their wickedness, and said, Why make ye trial of me, ye hypocrites? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Show me the tribute money.
<br>
 And they brought unto him a denarius.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> They say unto him, Caesar’s.
<br>
 Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and unto Elokim the things that are Elokim’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And when they heard it, they marvelled, and left him, and went away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> On that day there came to him Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> saying, Teacher, Musa said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> in like manner the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And after them all, the woman died.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by Elokim, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> I am the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), and the Elokim of Ishaq (Isaac), and the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob)? Elokim is not the Elokim of the dead, but of the living.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, trying him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And he said unto him, Thou shalt love HaAdon thy Elokim with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> This is the great and first commandment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And a second like unto it is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> On these two commandments the whole law hangeth, and the prophets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]asked them a question, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> saying, What think ye of al-Masih? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> He saith unto them, How then doth David (Dawad) in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> HaAdon said unto my Lord,
<br>
Sit thou on my right hand,
<br>
Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> If David (Dawad) then calleth him Lord, how is he his son? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And no one was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.
