<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of embalming: and the Egyptians wept for him threescore and ten days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And when the days of weeping for him were past, Yusuf (Joseph) spoke unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me.
<br>
 Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and all the house of Yusuf (Joseph), and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And they came to the threshing-floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:<sup class="versenum">13</sup> for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Ibrahim (Abraham) bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] with the field, for a possession of a burying-place, of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And when Yusuf’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Yusuf (Joseph) will hate us, and will fully requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And they sent a message unto Yusuf (Joseph), saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> So shall ye say unto Yusuf (Joseph), Forgive, I pray thee now, the transgression of thy brethren, and their sin, for that they did unto thee evil.
<br>
 And now, we pray thee, forgive the transgression of the servants of the Elokim of thy father.
<br>
 And Yusuf (Joseph) wept when they spoke unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we are thy servants.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of Elokim? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but Elokim meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones.
<br>
 And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Yusuf (Joseph) lived a hundred and ten years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were born upon Yusuf’s knees.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) said unto his brethren, I die; but Elokim will surely visit you, and bring you up out of this land unto the land which he sware to Ibrahim (Abraham), to Ishaq (Isaac), and to Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, Elokim will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> So Yusuf (Joseph) died, being a hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
