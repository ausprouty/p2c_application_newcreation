<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now when morning was come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]to put him to death:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him up to Pilate the governor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Then Judas, who betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> saying, I have sinned in that I betrayed innocent blood.
<br>
 But they said, What is that to us? see thou to it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he cast down the pieces of silver into the sanctuary, and departed; and he went away and hanged himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the chief priests took the pieces of silver, and said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is the price of blood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field, to bury strangers in.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then was fulfilled that which was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was priced, whom certain of the children of Israel did price; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and they gave them for the potter’s field, as HaAdon appointed me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]stood before the governor: and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Thou sayest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he answered nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then saith Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he gave him no answer, not even to one word: insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Now at the feast the governor was wont to release unto the multitude one prisoner, whom they would.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]who is called Masih? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For he knew that for envy they had delivered him up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And while he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that righteous man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes that they should ask for Barabbas, and destroy [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But the governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two will ye that I release unto you? And they said, Barabbas.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Pilate saith unto them, What then shall I do unto [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]who is called Masih? They all say, Let him be pierced alive on the Tree [T.N. See 2Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid (Son of David) pierced hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a mevaser (2 Timothy 4:5) announcer of Good News of Al-Salaam to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, saying, Let him be pierced alive on the Tree [T.N. See 2Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid (Son of David) pierced hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a mevaser (2 Timothy 4:5) announcer of Good News of Al-Salaam to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> So when Pilate saw that he prevailed nothing, but rather that a tumult was arising, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this righteous man; see ye to it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And all the people answered and said, His blood be on us, and on our children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Then released he unto them Barabbas; but [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]he scourged and delivered to be pierced alive on the Tree
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Then the soldiers of the governor took [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]into the Praetorium, and gathered unto him the whole band.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And they platted a crown of thorns and put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand; and they kneeled down before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And they spat upon him, and took the reed and smote him on the head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the robe, and put on him his garments, and led him away to pierce alive on the Tree [T.N. See 2Samuel 18:9-33</sup> Ben Dovid pierced hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a Mevaser (2 Timothy 4:5) Announcer of Good News of Al-Salaam to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5] him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to go with them, that he might bear his Tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, The place of a skull, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted it, he would not drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And when they had pierced alive on the Tree [T.N. See 2Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid pierced hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a Mevaser (2 Timothy 4:5) Announcer of Good News of Al-Salaam to herald it; see Psalm 22</sup>:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5] him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> and they sat and watched him there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And they set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS [PROPHET] ISA [AL-MASIH PBUH]THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Then are there pierced alive on a Tree with him two robbers, one on the right hand and one on the left.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> and saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, save thyself: if thou art the Son of Elokim, come down from the Tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> In like manner also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> He saved others; himself he cannot save.
<br>
 He is the King of Israel; let him now come down from the Tree, and we will believe on him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> He trusteth on Elokim; let him deliver him now, if he desireth him: for he said, I am the Son of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And the robbers also that were pierced alive on a Tree with him cast upon him the same reproach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And about the ninth hour [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is, My Elokim, my Elokim, why hast thou forsaken me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And some of them that stood there, when they heard it, said, This man calleth IIyas (Elijah).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And straightway one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And the rest said, Let be; let us see whether IIyas (Elijah) cometh to save him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake; and the rocks were rent; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> and coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection they entered into the holy city and appeared unto many.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (<sup class="versenum">46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]from Galilee, ministering unto him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> And when even was come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Yosef, who also himself was a disciple of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
 Then Pilate commanded it to be given up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> And Yosef took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">61</sup> And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">62</sup> Now on the morrow, which is the day after the Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together unto Pilate, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">63</sup> saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">64</sup> Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest haply his disciples come and steal him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: and the last error will be worse than the first.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">65</sup> Pilate said unto them, Ye have a guard: go, make it as sure as ye can.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">66</sup> So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, the guard being with them.
