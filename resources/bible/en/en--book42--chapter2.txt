<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now it came to pass in those days, there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be enrolled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> This was the first enrolment made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And all went to enrol themselves, every one to his own city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Yosef also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David (Dawad), which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David (Dawad); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> to enrol himself with Maryam, who was betrothed to him, being great with child.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And it came to pass, while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should be delivered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And she brought forth her firstborn son; and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And there were shepherds in the same country abiding in the field, and keeping watch by night over their flock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And an angel of HaAdon stood by them, and the glory of HaAdon shone round about them: and they were sore afraid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the angel said unto them, Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> for there is born to you this day in the city of David (Dawad) a Saviour, who is al-Masih HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And this is the sign unto you: Ye shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising Elokim, and saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Glory to Elokim in the highest,
<br>
And on earth peace among men in whom he is well pleased.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And it came to pass, when the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing that is come to pass, which HaAdon hath made known unto us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And they came with haste, and found both Maryam and Yosef, and the babe lying in the manger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And when they saw it, they made known concerning the saying which was spoken to them about this child.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And all that heard it wondered at the things which were spoken unto them by the shepherds.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But Maryam kept all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising Elokim for all the things that they had heard and seen, even as it was spoken unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And when eight days were fulfilled for circumcising him, his name was called [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] (see Zechariah 6:11-12), which was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And when the days of their purification according to the law of Musa were fulfilled, they brought him up to Jerusalem, to present him to HaAdon 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> (as it is written in the law of HaAdon, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to HaAdon), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of HaAdon, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ruach was upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And it had been revealed unto him by the Holy Ruach, that he should not see death, before he had seen HaAdon al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And he came in the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], that they might do concerning him after the custom of the law, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> then he received him into his arms, and blessed Elokim, and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Now lettest thou thy servant depart, Lord,
<br>
According to thy word, in peace;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> For mine eyes have seen thy salvation,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Which thou hast prepared before the face of all peoples;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> A light for revelation to the Gentiles,
<br>
And the glory of thy people Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And his father and his mother were marvelling at the things which were spoken concerning him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> and Simeon blessed them, and said unto Maryam his mother, Behold, this child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel; and for a sign which is spoken against; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> yea and a sword shall pierce through thine own soul; that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher (she was of a great age, having lived with a husband seven years from her virginity, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> and she had been a widow even unto fourscore and four years), who departed not from the temple, worshipping with fastings and supplications night and day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks unto Elokim, and spoke of him to all them that were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And when they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of HaAdon, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And the child grew, and waxed strong, filled with wisdom: and the grace of Elokim was upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And his parents went every year to Jerusalem at the feast of the passover.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And when he was twelve years old, they went up after the custom of the feast; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> and when they had fulfilled the days, as they were returning, the boy [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]tarried behind in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> but supposing him to be in the company, they went a day’s journey; and they sought for him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> and when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And it came to pass, after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> and all that heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And when they saw him, they were astonished; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I sought thee sorrowing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be in my Father’s house? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And they understood not the saying which he spoke unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth; and he was subject unto them: and his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]advanced in wisdom and stature, and in favor with Elokim and men.
