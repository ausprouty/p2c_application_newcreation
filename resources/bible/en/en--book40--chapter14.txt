<sup class="versenum">1</sup> At that season Herod the tetrarch heard the report concerning [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh],
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and said unto his servants, This is Yahya the Immerser; he is risen from the dead; and therefore do these powers work in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But when Herod’s birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And she, being put forward by her mother, saith, Give me here on a platter the head of Yahya the Immerser.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the king was grieved; but for the sake of his oaths, and of them that sat at meat with him, he commanded it to be given; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And his head was brought on a platter, and given to the damsel: and she brought it to her mother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And his disciples came, and took up the corpse, and buried him; and they went and told [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Now when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]heard it, he withdrew from thence in a boat, to a desert place apart: and when the multitudes heard thereof, they followed him on foot from the cities.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he came forth, and saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And when even was come, the disciples came to him, saying, The place is desert, and the time is already past; send the multitudes away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves food.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, They have no need to go away; give ye them to eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he said, Bring them hither to me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he commanded the multitudes to sit down on the grass; and he took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake and gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And they all ate, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they that did eat were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And straightway he constrained the disciples to enter into the boat, and to go before him unto the other side, till he should send the multitudes away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And after he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into the mountain apart to pray: and when even was come, he was there alone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves; for the wind was contrary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And in the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But straightway [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]spoke unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee upon the waters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And he said, Come.
<br>
 And Peter went down from the boat, and walked upon the waters to come to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> But when he saw the wind, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And immediately [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]stretched forth his hand, and took hold of him, and saith unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And when they were gone up into the boat, the wind ceased.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And they that were in the boat worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of [Atik Yomin] Elokim [T.N. See Daniel 7:13-14; Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And when they had crossed over, they came to the land, unto Gennesaret.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And when the men of that place knew him, they sent into all that region round about, and brought unto him all that were sick; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> and they besought him that they might only touch the border of his garment: and as many as touched were made whole.
