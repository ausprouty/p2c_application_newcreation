<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now the word of تتراجراماتون came unto Yunus (Jonah) the son of Amittai, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But Yunus (Jonah) rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of تتراجراماتون; and he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But تتراجراماتون sent out a great wind upon the sea, and there was a mighty tempest on the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his Elokim; and they cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it unto them. But Yunus (Jonah) was gone down into the innermost parts of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy Elokim, if so be that Elokim will think upon us, that we perish not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.
<br>
 So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Yunus (Jonah).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil is upon us; what is thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people art thou? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of heaven, who hath made the sea and the dry land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? For the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of تتراجراماتون, because he had told them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea grew more and more tempestuous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Nevertheless the men rowed hard to get them back to the land; but they could not: for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Wherefore they cried unto تتراجراماتون, and said, We beseech thee, O تتراجراماتون, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man’s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood; for thou, O تتراجراماتون, hast done as it pleased thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So they took up Yunus (Jonah), and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from its raging.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Then the men feared تتراجراماتون exceedingly; and they offered a sacrifice unto تتراجراماتون, and made vows.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And تتراجراماتون prepared a great fish to swallow up Yunus (Jonah); and Yunus (Jonah) was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.
