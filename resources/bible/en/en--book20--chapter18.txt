<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire,
<br>
And rageth against all sound wisdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> A fool hath no delight in understanding,
<br>
But only that his heart may reveal itself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt,
<br>
And with ignominy cometh reproach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters;
<br>
The wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> To respect the person of the wicked is not good,
<br>
Nor to turn aside the righteous in judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> A fool’s lips enter into contention,
<br>
And his mouth calleth for stripes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> A fool’s mouth is his destruction,
<br>
And his lips are the snare of his soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
<br>
And they go down into the innermost parts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He also that is slack in his work
<br>
Is brother to him that is a destroyer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The name of تتراجراماتون is a strong tower;
<br>
The righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city,
<br>
And as a high wall in his own imagination.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Before destruction the heart of man is haughty;
<br>
And before honor goeth humility.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He that giveth answer before he heareth,
<br>
It is folly and shame unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity;
<br>
But a broken spirit who can bear?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The heart of the prudent getteth [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] knowledge; And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> A man’s gift maketh room for him,
<br>
And bringeth him before great men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just;
<br>
But his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The lot causeth contentions to cease,
<br>
And parteth between the mighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city;
<br>
And such contentions are like the bars of a castle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth;
<br>
With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Death and life are in the power of the tongue;
<br>
And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing,
<br>
And obtaineth favor of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The poor useth entreaties;
<br>
But the rich answereth roughly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> He that maketh many friends doeth it to his own destruction;
<br>
But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
