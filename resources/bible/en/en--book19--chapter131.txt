<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Song of Ascents; of Dawad) تتراجراماتون, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty;
<br>
Neither do I exercise myself in great matters,
<br>
Or in things too wonderful for me.

<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul;
<br>
Like a weaned child with his mother,
<br>
Like a weaned child is my soul within me.

<br>
From this time forth and for evermore.
