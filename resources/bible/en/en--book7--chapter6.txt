<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون: and تتراجراماتون delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came up against them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For they came up with their cattle and their tents; they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their camels were without number: and they came into the land to destroy it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children of Israel cried unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto تتراجراماتون because of Midian, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> that تتراجراماتون sent a prophet unto the children of Israel: and he said unto them, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drove them out from before you, and gave you their land; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and I said unto you, I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim; ye shall not fear the Elokim of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell.
<br>
 But ye have not hearkened unto my voice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون came, and sat under the oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون appeared unto him, and said unto him, تتراجراماتون is with thee, thou mighty man of valor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Gideon said unto him, Oh, my lord, if تتراجراماتون is with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where are all his wondrous works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not تتراجراماتون bring us up from Egypt? but now تتراجراماتون hath cast us off, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And تتراجراماتون looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and save Israel from the hand of Midian: have not I sent thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he said unto him, Oh, Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And he said unto him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, then show me a sign that it is thou that talkest with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and lay it before thee.
<br>
 And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of meal: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the angel of Elokim said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.
<br>
 And he did so.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Then the angel of تتراجراماتون put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of تتراجراماتون departed out of his sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Gideon saw that he was the angel of تتراجراماتون; and Gideon said, Alas, O Lord تتراجراماتون! forasmuch as I have seen the angel of تتراجراماتون face to face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Then Gideon built an altar there unto تتراجراماتون, and called it تتراجراماتون-shalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And it came to pass the same night, that تتراجراماتون said unto him, Take thy father’s bullock, even the second bullock seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the Asherah that is by it; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and build an altar unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim upon the top of this stronghold, in the orderly manner, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt-offering with the wood of the Asherah which thou shalt cut down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as تتراجراماتون had spoken unto him: and it came to pass, because he feared his father’s household and the men of the city, so that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die, because he hath broken down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the Asherah that was by it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? Or will ye save him? he that will contend for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a Elokim, let him contend for himself, because one hath broken down his altar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him, because he hath broken down his altar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over, and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> But the Spirit of تتراجراماتون came upon Gideon; and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered together after him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were gathered together after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And Gideon said unto Elokim, If thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing-floor; if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the ground, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And it was so; for he rose up early on the morrow, and pressed the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece, a bowlful of water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And Gideon said unto Elokim, Let not thine anger be kindled against me, and I will speak but this once: let me make trial, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And Elokim did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
