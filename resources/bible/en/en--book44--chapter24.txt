<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and with an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying,
<br>
Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by thy providence evils are corrected for this nation, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup>But the chief captain Lysias came and with great violence took him away from our hands, and ordered his adversaries to come unto you. 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup>from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered,
<br>
Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I cheerfully make my defence: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> seeing that thou canst take knowledge that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the Elokim of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> having hope toward Elokim, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Herein I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward Elokim and men always.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Now after some years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but there were certain Jews from Asiaâ€™ 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found when I stood before the council, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And as he reasoned of righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.
