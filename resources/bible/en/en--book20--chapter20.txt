<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Wine is a mocker, strong drink a brawler;
<br>
And whosoever erreth thereby is not wise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The terror of a king is as the roaring of a lion:
<br>
He that provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife;
<br>
But every fool will be quarrelling.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The sluggard will not plow by reason of the winter;
<br>
Therefore he shall beg in harvest, and have nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water;
<br>
But a man of understanding will draw it out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Most men will proclaim every one his own kindness;
<br>
But a faithful man who can find?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> A righteous man that walketh in his integrity,
<br>
Blessed are his children after him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> A king that sitteth on the throne of judgment
<br>
Scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Who can say, I have made my heart clean,
<br>
I am pure from my sin?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Diverse weights, and diverse measures,
<br>
Both of them alike are an abomination to تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Even a child maketh himself known by his doings,
<br>
Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The hearing ear, and the seeing eye,
<br>
تتراجراماتون hath made even both of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty;
<br>
Open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> It is bad, it is bad, saith the buyer [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41];
<br>
But when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> There is gold, and abundance of rubies;
<br>
But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;
<br>
And hold him in pledge that is surety for foreigners.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man;
<br>
But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Every purpose is established by counsel;
<br>
And by wise guidance make thou war.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets;
<br>
Therefore company not with him that openeth wide his lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Whoso curseth his father or his mother,
<br>
His lamp shall be put out in blackness of darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning;
<br>
But the end thereof shall not be blessed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Say not thou, I will recompense evil:
<br>
Wait for تتراجراماتون, and he will save thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Diverse weights are an abomination to تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And a false balance is not good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> A man’s goings are of تتراجراماتون;
<br>
How then can man understand his way?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> It is a snare to a man rashly to say, It is holy,
<br>
And after vows to make inquiry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> A wise king winnoweth the wicked,
<br>
And bringeth the threshing-wheel over them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> The spirit of man is the lamp of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Searching all his innermost parts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Kindness and truth preserve the king;
<br>
And his throne is upholden by kindness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> The glory of young men is their strength;
<br>
And the beauty of old men is the hoary head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Stripes that wound cleanse away evil;
<br>
And strokes reach the innermost parts.
