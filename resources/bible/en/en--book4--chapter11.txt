<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the people were as murmurers, speaking evil in the ears of تتراجراماتون: and when تتراجراماتون heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire of تتراجراماتون burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost part of the camp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the people cried unto Musa; and Musa prayed unto تتراجراماتون, and the fire abated.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire of تتراجراماتون burnt among them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And the mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt for nought; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save this manna to look upon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance thereof as the appearance of bdellium.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Musa heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent: and the anger of تتراجراماتون was kindled greatly; and Musa was displeased.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Musa said unto تتراجراماتون, Wherefore hast thou dealt ill with thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Have I conceived all this people? have I brought them forth, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father carrieth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tent of meeting, that they may stand there with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the Spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of تتراجراماتون, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore تتراجراماتون will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you; because that ye have rejected تتراجراماتون who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And Musa said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Is تتراجراماتون’s hand waxed short? now shalt thou see whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Musa went out, and told the people the words of تتراجراماتون: and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the Tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And تتراجراماتون came down in the cloud, and spoke unto him, and took of the Spirit that was upon him, and put it upon the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but had not gone out unto the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And there ran a young man, and told Musa, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Musa, one of his chosen men, answered and said, My lord Musa, forbid them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Musa said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? would that all تتراجراماتون’s people were prophets, that تتراجراماتون would put his Spirit upon them! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And Musa gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And there went forth a wind from تتراجراماتون, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day’s journey on this side, and a day’s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and about two cubits above the face of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And the people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> While the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the anger of تتراجراماتون was kindled against the people, and تتراجراماتون smote the people with a very great plague.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And the name of that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah, because there they buried the people that lusted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed unto Hazeroth; and they abode at Hazeroth.
