<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Are we beginning again to commend ourselves? or need we, as do some, epistles of commendation to you or from you?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, known and read of all men; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> being made manifest that ye are an epistle of Al-Masih, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living Elokim; not in tables of stone, but in tables that are hearts of flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And such confidence have we through al-Masih toward Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to account anything as from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But if the ministration of death, written, and engraven on stones, came with glory, so that the children of Israel could not look stedfastly upon the face of Musa for the glory of his face; which glory was passing away: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> how shall not rather the ministration of the spirit be with glory? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For if the ministration of condemnation hath glory, much rather doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For verily that which hath been made glorious hath not been made glorious in this respect, by reason of the glory that surpasseth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For if that which passeth away was with glory, much more that which remaineth is in glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Having therefore such a hope, we use great boldness of speech, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and are not as Musa, who put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look stedfastly on the end of that which was passing away: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> but their minds were hardened: for until this very day at the reading of the old covenant the same veil remaineth, it not being revealed to them that it is done away in Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But unto this day, whensoever Musa is read, a veil lieth upon their heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But whensoever it shall turn to HaAdon, the veil is taken away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Now HaAdon is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of HaAdon is, there is liberty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But we all, with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of HaAdon, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from HaAdon the Spirit.
