<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Dawad. Michtam; when Saul sent, and they watched the house to kill him) Deliver me from mine enemies, O my Elokim: Set me on high from them that rise up against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Deliver me from the workers of iniquity,
<br>
And save me from the bloodthirsty men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul;
<br>
The mighty gather themselves together against me:
<br>
Not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> They run and prepare themselves without my fault:
<br>
Awake thou to help me, and behold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Even thou, O تتراجراماتون Elokim of hosts, the Elokim of Israel,
<br>
Arise to visit all the nations:
<br>
Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> They return at evening, they howl like a dog,
<br>
And go round about the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Behold, they belch out with their mouth;
<br>
Swords are in their lips:
<br>
For who, say they, doth hear?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But thou, O تتراجراماتون, wilt laugh at them;
<br>
Thou wilt have all the nations in derision.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Because of his strength I will give heed unto thee;
<br>
For Elokim is my high tower.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> My Elokim with his lovingkindness will meet me:
<br>
Elokim will let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Slay them not, lest my people forget:
<br>
Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down,
<br>
O Lord our shield.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For the sin of their mouth, and the words of their lips,
<br>
Let them even be taken in their pride,
<br>
And for cursing and lying which they speak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Consume them in wrath, consume them, so that they shall be no more:
<br>
And let them know that Elokim ruleth in Ya’qub (Jacob),
<br>
Unto the ends of the earth.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And at evening let them return, let them howl like a dog,
<br>
And go round about the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> They shall wander up and down for food,
<br>
And tarry all night if they be not satisfied.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But I will sing of thy strength;
<br>
Yea, I will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning:
<br>
For thou hast been my high tower,
<br>
And a refuge in the day of my distress.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing praises:
<br>
For Elokim is my high tower, the Elokim of my mercy.
