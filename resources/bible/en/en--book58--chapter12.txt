<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Therefore let us also, seeing we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> looking unto [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the Tree, despising shame, and hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For consider him that hath endured such gainsaying of sinners against himself, that ye wax not weary, fainting in your souls.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and ye have forgotten the exhortation which reasoneth with you as with sons,
<br>
My son, regard not lightly the chastening of HaAdon,
<br>
Nor faint when thou art reproved of him;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For whom HaAdon loveth he chasteneth,
<br>
And scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> It is for chastening that ye endure; Elokim dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is there whom his father chasteneth not? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But if ye are without chastening, whereof all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Furthermore, we had the fathers of our flesh to chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed good to them; but he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> All chastening seemeth for the present to be not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable fruit unto them that have been exercised thereby, even the fruit of righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Wherefore lift up the hands that hang down, and the palsied knees; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and make straight paths for your feet, that that which is lame be not turned out of the way, but rather be healed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Follow after peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no man shall see HaAdon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> looking carefully lest there be any man that falleth short of the grace of Elokim; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby the many be defiled; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one mess of meat sold his own birthright.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For ye know that even when he afterward desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for a change of mind in his father, though he sought it diligently with tears.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For ye are not come unto a mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, and unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice they that heard entreated that no word more should be spoken unto them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> for they could not endure that which was enjoined, If even a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and so fearful was the appearance, that Musa said, I exceedingly fear and quake:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> but ye are come unto mount Zion, and unto the city of the living Elokim, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable hosts of angels,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> to the general assembly and New Creation Masjid of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to Elokim the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better than that of Abel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not when they refused him that warned them on earth, much more shall not we escape who turn away from him that warneth from heaven:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more will I make to tremble not the earth only, but also the heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that have been made, that those things which are not shaken may remain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Wherefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have grace, whereby we may offer service well-pleasing to Elokim with reverence and awe:  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> for our Elokim is a consuming fire.
