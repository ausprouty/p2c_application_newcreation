<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon the son of David (Dawad), king of Israel:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> To know wisdom and instruction;
<br>
To discern the words of understanding;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> To receive instruction in wise dealing,
<br>
In righteousness and justice and equity;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> To give prudence to the simple,
<br>
To the young man knowledge and discretion:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;
<br>
And that the man of understanding may acquire [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] sound counsels:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> To understand a proverb, and a figure,
<br>
The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The fear of تتراجراماتون is the beginning of knowledge;
<br>
But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> My son, hear the instruction of thy father,
<br>
And forsake not the law of thy mother:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head,
<br>
And chains about thy neck.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> My son, if sinners entice thee,
<br>
Consent thou not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> If they say, Come with us,
<br>
Let us lay wait for blood;
<br>
Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol,
<br>
And whole, as those that go down into the pit;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> We shall find all precious substance;
<br>
We shall fill our houses with spoil;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thou shalt cast thy lot among us;
<br>
We will all have one purse:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> My son, walk not thou in the way with them;
<br>
Refrain thy foot from their path:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For their feet run to evil,
<br>
And they make haste to shed blood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For in vain is the net spread
<br>
In the sight of any bird:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And these lay wait for their own blood;
<br>
They lurk privily for their own lives.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;
<br>
It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Wisdom crieth aloud in the street;
<br>
She uttereth her voice in the broad places;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> She crieth in the chief place of concourse;
<br>
At the entrance of the gates,
<br>
In the city, she uttereth her words:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?
<br>
And scoffers delight them in scoffing,
<br>
And fools hate knowledge?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Turn you at my reproof:
<br>
Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you;
<br>
I will make known my words unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Because I have called, and ye have refused;
<br>
I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But ye have set at nought all my counsel,
<br>
And would none of my reproof:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> I also will laugh in the day of your calamity;
<br>
I will mock when your fear cometh;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> When your fear cometh as a storm,
<br>
And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind;
<br>
When distress and anguish come upon you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer;
<br>
They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For that they hated knowledge,
<br>
And did not choose the fear of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> They would none of my counsel,
<br>
They despised all my reproof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,
<br>
And be filled with their own devices.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them,
<br>
And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely,
<br>
And shall be quiet without fear of evil.
