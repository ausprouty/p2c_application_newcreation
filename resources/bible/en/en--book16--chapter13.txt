<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> On that day they read in the book of Musa in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of Elokim for ever,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our Elokim turned the curse into a blessing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our Elokim, being allied unto Tobiah, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of Elokim, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of Elokim forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Remember me, O my Elokim, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my Elokim, and for the observances thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses therewith; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Did not your fathers thus, and did not our Elokim bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.
<br>
 From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day.
<br>
 Remember unto me, O my Elokim, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jewsâ€™ language, but according to the language of each people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by Elokim, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his Elokim, and Elokim made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our Elokim in marrying foreign women?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Remember them, O my Elokim, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my Elokim, for good.
