<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And afterward Musa and Haron (Aaron) came, and said unto Pharaoh, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Pharaoh said, Who is تتراجراماتون, that I should hearken unto his voice to let Israel go? I know not تتراجراماتون, and moreover I will not let Israel go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And they said, The Elokim of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto تتراجراماتون our Elokim, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore do ye, Musa and Haron (Aaron), loose the people from their works? get you unto your burdens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the number of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof: for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein; and let them not regard lying words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it: for nought of your work shall be diminished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfil your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and to-day, in making brick as heretofore?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and, behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thine own people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were in evil case, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, your daily tasks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And they met Musa and Haron (Aaron), who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and they said unto them, تتراجراماتون look upon you, and judge: because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Musa returned unto تتراجراماتون, and said, Lord, wherefore hast thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
