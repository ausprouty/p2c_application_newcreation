<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Being therefore justified by faith, we have peace with Elokim through our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] [T.N. This gives the rationale behind the urgency of Isaiah 53:11 which says of al-Masih, He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of him (see John 14:9) shall my righteous servant justify many (see Genesis 15:6; Habakkuk 2:4. Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:28; Galatians 3:24. No al-Salaam peace with تتراجراماتون without faith in Masih and depending on him alone to be put right with تتراجراماتون; and, yes, true faith is active in love, Galatians 5:6; James 2:14, 17, 20, 26; Ephesians 2:10). We see from Exodus 12:13 the token in that verse that points to Isaiah 53:7 and John 14:6 and constitutes the token of justification (<sup class="versenum">9) and admission to heaven.];
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> through whom also we have had our access by faith into this grace wherein we stand; and we rejoice in hope of the glory of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And not only so, but we also rejoice in our tribulations: knowing that tribulation worketh stedfastness; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and stedfastness, approvedness; and approvedness, hope: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and hope putteth not to shame; because the love of Elokim hath been shed abroad in our hearts through the Holy Ruach which was given unto us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For while we were yet weak, in due season al-Masih died for the ungodly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: for peradventure for the good man some one would even dare to die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But Elokim commendeth his own love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, al-Masih died for us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Much more then, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from the wrath of Elokim through him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to Elokim through the death of his Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and not only so, but we also rejoice in Elokim through our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], through whom we have now received the reconciliation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Therefore, as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin; and so death passed unto all men, for that all sinned:’ 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> for until the law sin was in the world; but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Musa, even over them that had not sinned after the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is a figure of him that was to come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But not as the trespass, so also is the free gift.
<br>
 For if by the trespass of the one the many died, much more did the grace of Elokim, and the gift by the grace of the one man, [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], abound unto the many.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And not as through one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment came of one unto condemnation, but the free gift came of many trespasses unto justification.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For if, by the trespass of the one, death reigned through the one; much more shall they that receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, even [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> So then as through one trespass the judgment came unto all men to condemnation; even so through one act of righteousness the free gift came unto all men to justification of life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For as through the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the one shall the many be made righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the law came in besides, that the trespass might abound; but where sin abounded, grace did abound more exceedingly: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> that, as sin reigned in death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] our Lord.
