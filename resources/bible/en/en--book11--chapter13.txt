<sup class="versenum">1</sup>And, behold, there came a man of Elokim out of Judah by the word of تتراجراماتون unto Beth-el: and Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn incense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he cried against the altar by the word of تتراجراماتون, and said, O altar, altar, thus saith تتراجراماتون: Behold, a son shall be born unto the house of David (Dawad), Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he sacrifice the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s bones shall they burn upon thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which تتراجراماتون hath spoken: Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And it came to pass, when the king heard the saying of the man of Elokim, which he cried against the altar in Beth-el, that Jeroboam put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him.
<br>
 And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back again to him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of Elokim had given by the word of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the king answered and said unto the man of Elokim, Entreat now the favor of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me again.
<br>
 And the man of Elokim entreated تتراجراماتون, and the king’s hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the king said unto the man of Elokim, Come home with me, and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the man of Elokim said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> for so was it charged me by the word of تتراجراماتون, saying, Thou shalt eat no bread, nor drink water, neither return by the way that thou camest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he came to Beth-el.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now there dwelt an old prophet in Beth-el; and one of his sons came and told him all the works that the man of Elokim had done that day in Beth-el: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them also they told unto their father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And their father said unto them, What way went he? Now his sons had seen what way the man of Elokim went, that came from Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass.
<br>
 So they saddled him the ass; and he rode thereon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he went after the man of Elokim, and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of Elokim that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> for it was said to me by the word of تتراجراماتون, Thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he said unto him, I also am a prophet as thou art; and an angel spoke unto me by the word of تتراجراماتون, saying, Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread and drink water.
<br>
 But he lied unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and drank water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of تتراجراماتون came unto the prophet that brought him back; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and he cried unto the man of Elokim that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, Forasmuch as thou hast been disobedient unto the mouth of تتراجراماتون, and hast not kept the commandment which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim commanded thee, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> but camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water; thy body shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he had brought back.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him: and his body was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it; the lion also stood by the body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And, behold, men passed by, and saw the body cast in the way, and the lion standing by the body; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof, he said, It is the man of Elokim, who was disobedient unto the mouth of تتراجراماتون: therefore تتراجراماتون hath delivered him unto the lion, which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of تتراجراماتون, which he spoke unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass.
<br>
 And they saddled it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And he went and found his body cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the body: the lion had not eaten the body, nor torn the ass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And the prophet took up the body of the man of Elokim, and laid it upon the ass, and brought it back; and he came to the city of the old prophet, to mourn, and to bury him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And he laid his body in his own grave; and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of Elokim is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For the saying which he cried by the word of تتراجراماتون against the altar in Beth-el, and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but made again from among all the people priests of the high places: whosoever would, he consecrated him, that there might be priests of the high places.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.
