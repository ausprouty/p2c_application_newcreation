<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Psalm of Dawad) Unto thee, O تتراجراماتون, will I call:
<br>
My rock, be not thou deaf unto me;
<br>
Lest, if thou be silent unto me,
<br>
I become like them that go down into the pit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee,
<br>
When I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Draw me not away with the wicked,
<br>
And with the workers of iniquity;
<br>
That speak peace with their neighbors,
<br>
But mischief is in their hearts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Give them according to their work, and according to the wickedness of their doings:
<br>
Give them after the operation of their hands;
<br>
Render to them their desert.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Because they regard not the works of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Nor the operation of his hands,
<br>
He will break them down and not build them up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Blessed be تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> تتراجراماتون is my strength and my shield;
<br>
My heart hath trusted in him, and I am helped:
<br>
Therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
<br>
And with my song will I praise him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> تتراجراماتون is their strength,
<br>
And he is a stronghold of salvation to his anointed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance:
<br>
Be their shepherd also, and bear them up for ever.
