<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I have seen the travail which Elokim hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that Elokim hath done from the beginning even to the end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I know that, whatsoever Elokim doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and Elokim hath done it, that men should fear before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and Elokim seeketh again that which is passed away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> I said in my heart, Elokim will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that Elokim may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him back to see what shall be after him?
