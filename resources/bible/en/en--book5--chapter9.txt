<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Hear, O Israel: thou art to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fortified up to heaven,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Know therefore this day, that تتراجراماتون thy Elokim is he who goeth over before thee as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before thee: so shalt thou drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as تتراجراماتون hath spoken unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Speak not thou in thy heart, after that تتراجراماتون thy Elokim hath thrust them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness تتراجراماتون hath brought me in to possess this land; whereas for the wickedness of these nations تتراجراماتون doth drive them out from before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thy heart, dost thou go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations تتراجراماتون thy Elokim doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which تتراجراماتون sware unto thy fathers, to Ibrahim (Abraham), to Ishaq (Isaac), and to Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Know therefore, that تتراجراماتون thy Elokim giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou art a stiffnecked people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Remember, forget thou not, how thou provokedst تتراجراماتون thy Elokim to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Also in Horeb ye provoked تتراجراماتون to wrath, and تتراجراماتون was angry with you to destroy you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which تتراجراماتون made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And تتراجراماتون delivered unto me the two tables of stone written with the finger of Elokim; and on them was written according to all the words, which تتراجراماتون spoke with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that تتراجراماتون gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Furthermore تتراجراماتون spoke unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against تتراجراماتون your Elokim; ye had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which تتراجراماتون had commanded you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And I fell down before تتراجراماتون, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which ye sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون, to provoke him to anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith تتراجراماتون was wroth against you to destroy you.
<br>
 But تتراجراماتون hearkened unto me that time also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And تتراجراماتون was very angry with Haron (Aaron) to destroy him: and I prayed for Haron (Aaron) also at the same time.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked تتراجراماتون to wrath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when تتراجراماتون sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of تتراجراماتون your Elokim, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Ye have been rebellious against تتراجراماتون from the day that I knew you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> So I fell down before تتراجراماتون the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because تتراجراماتون had said he would destroy you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And I prayed unto تتراجراماتون, and said, O Lord تتراجراماتون, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, that thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, that thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Remember thy servants, Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaq (Isaac), and Ya’qub (Jacob); look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because تتراجراماتون was not able to bring them into the land which he promised unto them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy great power and by thine outstretched arm.
