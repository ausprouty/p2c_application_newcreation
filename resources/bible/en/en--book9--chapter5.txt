<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now the Philistines had taken the ark of Elokim, and they brought it from Eben-ezer unto Ashdod.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the Philistines took the ark of Elokim, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of تتراجراماتون.  And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of تتراجراماتون; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands lay cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was left to him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon’s house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But the hand of تتراجراماتون was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the Elokim of Israel shall not abide with us; for his hand is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the Elokim of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the Elokim of Israel be carried about unto Gath.  And they carried the ark of the Elokim of Israel thither.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of تتراجراماتون was against the city with a very great discomfiture: and he smote the men of the city, both small and great; and tumors brake out upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> So they sent the ark of Elokim to Ekron.  And it came to pass, as the ark of Elokim came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the Elokim of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the Elokim of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it slay us not, and our people.  For there was a deadly discomfiture throughout all the city; the hand of Elokim was very heavy there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And the men that died not were smitten with the tumors; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
