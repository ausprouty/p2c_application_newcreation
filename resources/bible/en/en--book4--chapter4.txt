<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families, by their fathers’ houses, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter upon the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, about the most holy things: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> when the camp setteth forward, Haron (Aaron) shall go in, and his sons, and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover the ark of the testimony with it, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and shall put thereon a covering of sealskin, and shall spread over it a cloth all of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls and the cups wherewith to pour out; and the continual bread shall be thereon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in the staves thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and its lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:

<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of sealskin, and shall put it upon the frame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in the staves thereof:

<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And when Haron (Aaron) and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the furniture of the sanctuary, as the camp is set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die.
<br>
 These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting.

<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> but thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: Haron (Aaron) and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment, lest they die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Take the sum of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’ houses, by their families; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to wait upon the service, to do the work in the tent of meeting.

<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tent of meeting, its covering, and the covering of sealskin that is above upon it, and the screen for the door of the tent of meeting, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and whatsoever shall be done with them: therein shall they serve.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> At the commandment of Haron (Aaron) and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden, and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burden.

<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them by their families, by their fathers’ houses; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth upon the service, to do the work of the tent of meeting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tent of meeting: the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> and the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall appoint the instruments of the charge of their burden.
