<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor.
<br>
 And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers: and her hap was to light on the portion of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, تتراجراماتون be with you.
<br>
 And they answered him, تتراجراماتون bless thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.
<br>
 So she came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, save that she tarried a little in the house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from hence, but abide here fast by my maidens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said unto him, Why have I found favor in thy sight, that thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been showed me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband; and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people that thou knewest not heretofore.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> تتراجراماتون recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to take refuge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, for that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken kindly unto thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And at meal-time Boaz said unto her, Come hither, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar.
<br>
 And she sat beside the reapers, and they reached her parched grain, and she did eat, and was sufficed, and left thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and rebuke her not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And she took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day? and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee.
<br>
 And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrought, and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to-day is Boaz.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of تتراجراماتون, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.
<br>
 And Naomi said unto her, The man is nigh of kin unto us, one of our near kinsmen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yea, he said unto me, Thou shalt keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they meet thee not in any other field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she dwelt with her mother-in-law.
