<sup class="versenum">1</sup> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Elokim forbid.
<br>
 We who died to sin, how shall we any longer live therein? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Or are ye ignorant that all we who were baptized into [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]were baptized into his death? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> We were buried therefore with him through total immersion death ghusl burial into death: that like as al-Masih was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life [T.N. See 2 Kings 5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that God can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (<sup class="versenum">3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> knowing this, that our old man was put to death hanged on a Tree with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> for he that hath died is justified from sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But if we died with al-Masih, we believe that we shall also live with him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> knowing that al-Masih being raised from the dead dieth no more; death no more hath dominion over him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For the death that he died, he died unto sin once: but the life that he liveth, he liveth unto Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Even so reckon ye also yourselves to be dead unto sin, but alive unto Elokim in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey the lusts thereof: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> neither present your members unto sin as instruments of unrighteousness; but present yourselves unto Elokim, as alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace? Elokim forbid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves as servants unto obedience, his servants ye are whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But thanks be to Elokim, that, whereas ye were servants of sin, ye became obedient from the heart to that form of teaching whereunto ye were delivered; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and being made free from sin, ye became servants of righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye presented your members as servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now present your members as servants to righteousness unto sanctification.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For when ye were servants of sin, ye were free in regard of righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> What fruit then had ye at that time in the things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But now being made free from sin and become servants to Elokim, ye have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end eternal life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For the wages of sin is death; but the free gift of Elokim is eternal life in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] Adoneinu.
