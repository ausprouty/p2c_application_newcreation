<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah) Hear this, all ye peoples;
<br>
Give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Both low and high,
<br>
Rich and poor together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> My mouth shall speak wisdom;
<br>
And the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I will incline mine ear to a parable:
<br>
I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil,
<br>
When iniquity at my heels compasseth me about?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> They that trust in their wealth,
<br>
And boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> None of them can by any means redeem his brother,
<br>
Nor give to Elokim a ransom for him
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> (For the redemption of their life is costly,
<br>
And it faileth for ever),
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> That he should still live alway,
<br>
That he should not see corruption.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For he shall see it.
<br>
 Wise men die;
<br>
The fool and the brutish alike perish,
<br>
And leave their wealth to others.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever,
<br>
And their dwelling-places to all generations;
<br>
They call their lands after their own names.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But man being in honor abideth not:
<br>
He is like the beasts that perish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> This their way is their folly:
<br>
Yet after them men approve their sayings.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> They are appointed as a flock for Sheol;
<br>
Death shall be their shepherd:
<br>
And the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning;
<br>
And their beauty shall be for Sheol to consume,
<br>
That there be no habitation for it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But Elokim will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol;
<br>
For he will receive me.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Be not thou afraid when one is made rich,
<br>
When the glory of his house is increased:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away;
<br>
His glory shall not descend after him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Though while he lived he blessed his soul
<br>
(And men praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself),
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He shall go to the generation of his fathers;
<br>
They shall never see the light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Man that is in honor, and understandeth not,
<br>
Is like the beasts that perish.
