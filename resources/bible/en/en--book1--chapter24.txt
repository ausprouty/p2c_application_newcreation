<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) was old, and well stricken in age: and تتراجراماتون had blessed Ibrahim (Abraham) in all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) said unto his servant, the elder of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and I will make thee swear by تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of heaven and the Elokim of the earth, that thou wilt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> but thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son Ishaq (Isaac).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my nativity, and who spoke unto me, and who sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he will send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife for my son from thence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And if the woman be not willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath; only thou shalt not bring my son thither again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Ibrahim (Abraham) his master, and sware to him concerning this matter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the servant took ten camels, of the camels of his master, and departed, having all goodly things of his master’s in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of Nahor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he made the camels to kneel down without the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out to draw water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he said, O تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of my master Ibrahim (Abraham), send me, I pray thee, good speed this day, and show kindness unto my master Ibrahim (Abraham).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Ishaq (Isaac); and thereby shall I know that thou hast showed kindness unto my master.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Ibrahim (Abraham)’s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the fountain, and filled her pitcher, and came up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And the man looked stedfastly on her, holding his peace, to know whether تتراجراماتون had made his journey prosperous or not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee.
<br>
 Is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she bare unto Nahor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And the man bowed his head, and worshipped تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum"> 27</sup> And he said, Blessed be تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of my master Ibrahim (Abraham), who hath not forsaken his lovingkindness and his truth toward my master: as for me, تتراجراماتون hath led me in the way to the house of my master’s brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And the damsel ran, and told her mother’s house according to these words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out unto the man, unto the fountain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And it came to pass, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he was standing by the camels at the fountain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And he said, Come in, thou blessed of تتراجراماتون; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And the man came into the house, and he ungirded the camels; and he gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men that were with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And there was set food before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And he said, I am Ibrahim (Abraham)’s servant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And تتراجراماتون hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and men-servants and maid-servants, and camels and asses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And Sarah my master’s wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> but thou shalt go unto my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife for my son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And he said unto me, تتراجراماتون, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> then shalt thou be clear from my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give her not to thee, thou shalt be clear from my oath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And I came this day unto the fountain, and said, O تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of my master Ibrahim (Abraham), if now thou do prosper my way which I go:<sup class="versenum">43</sup> behold, I am standing by the fountain of water; and let it come to pass, that the almah (virgin Isaiah 7:14) that cometh forth to draw, to whom I shall say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher to drink; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom تتراجراماتون hath appointed for my master’s son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the fountain, and drew: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bare unto him: and I put the ring upon her nose, and the bracelets upon her hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And I bowed my head, and worshipped تتراجراماتون, and blessed تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of my master Ibrahim (Abraham), who had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter for his son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth from تتراجراماتون: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as تتراجراماتون hath spoken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> And it came to pass, that, when Ibrahim (Abraham)’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself down to the earth unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing تتراجراماتون hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Ibrahim (Abraham)’s servant, and his men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those that hate them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">61</sup> And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">62</sup> And Ishaq (Isaac) came from the way of Beer-lahai-roi; for he dwelt in the land of the South.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">63</sup> And Ishaq (Isaac) went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there were camels coming.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">64</sup> And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Ishaq (Isaac), she alighted from the camel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">65</sup> And she said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant said, It is my master: and she took her veil, and covered herself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">66</sup> And the servant told Ishaq (Isaac) all the things that he had done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">67</sup> And Ishaq (Isaac) brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. And Ishaq (Isaac) was comforted after his mother’s death.
