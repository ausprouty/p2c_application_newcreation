<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> My son, forget not my law;
<br>
But let thy heart keep my commandments:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For length of days, and years of life,
<br>
And peace, will they add to thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Let not kindness and truth forsake thee:
<br>
Bind them about thy neck;
<br>
Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> So shalt thou find favor and good understanding
<br>
In the sight of Elokim and man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Trust in تتراجراماتون with all thy heart,
<br>
And lean not upon thine own understanding:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> In all thy ways acknowledge him,
<br>
And he will direct thy paths.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Be not wise in thine own eyes;
<br>
Fear تتراجراماتون, and depart from evil:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> It will be health to thy navel,
<br>
And marrow to thy bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Honor تتراجراماتون with thy substance,
<br>
And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> So shall thy barns be filled with plenty,
<br>
And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> My son, despise not the chastening of تتراجراماتون;
<br>
Neither be weary of his reproof:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For whom تتراجراماتون loveth he reproveth,
<br>
Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Happy is the man that findeth wisdom,
<br>
And the man that getteth understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver,
<br>
And the profit thereof than fine gold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> She is more precious than rubies:
<br>
And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Length of days is in her right hand;
<br>
In her left hand are riches and honor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
<br>
And all her paths are peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her:
<br>
And happy is every one that retaineth her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> تتراجراماتون by wisdom founded the earth;
<br>
By understanding he established the heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> By his knowledge the depths were broken up,
<br>
And the skies drop down the dew.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> My son, let them not depart from thine eyes;
<br>
Keep sound wisdom and discretion:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> So shall they be life unto thy soul,
<br>
And grace to thy neck.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely,
<br>
And thy foot shall not stumble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid:
<br>
Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Be not afraid of sudden fear,
<br>
Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For تتراجراماتون will be thy confidence,
<br>
And will keep thy foot from being taken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,
<br>
When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again,
<br>
And to-morrow I will give;
<br>
When thou hast it by thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Devise not evil against thy neighbor,
<br>
Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Strive not with a man without cause,
<br>
If he have done thee no harm.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Envy thou not the man of violence,
<br>
And choose none of his ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For the perverse is an abomination to تتراجراماتون;
<br>
But his friendship is with the upright.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> The curse of تتراجراماتون is in the house of the wicked;
<br>
But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers;
<br>
But he giveth grace unto the lowly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> The wise shall inherit glory;
<br>
But shame shall be the promotion of fools.
