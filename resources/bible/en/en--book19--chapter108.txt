<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup> (A Song, A Psalm of Dawad) My heart is fixed, O Elokim;
<br>
I will sing, yea, I will sing praises, even with my glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Awake, psaltery and harp:
<br>
I myself will awake right early.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I will give thanks unto thee, O تتراجراماتون, among the peoples;
<br>
And I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For thy lovingkindness is great above the heavens;
<br>
And thy truth reacheth unto the skies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Be thou exalted, O Elokim, above the heavens,
<br>
And thy glory above all the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> That thy beloved may be delivered,
<br>
Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Elokim hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult;
<br>
I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine;
<br>
Ephraim also is the defence of my head;
<br>
Judah is my sceptre.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Moab is my washpot;
<br>
Upon Edom will I cast my shoe;
<br>
Over Philistia will I shout.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Who will bring me into the fortified city?
<br>
Who hath led me unto Edom?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Hast not thou cast us off, O Elokim?
<br>
And thou goest not forth, O Elokim, with our hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Give us help against the adversary;
<br>
For vain is the help of man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Through Elokim we shall do valiantly:
<br>
For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
