<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Masters, render unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Continue stedfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> withal praying for us also, that Elokim may open unto us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Al-Masih, for which I am also in bonds; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> All my affairs shall Tychicus make known unto you, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-servant in HaAdon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that ye may know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.
<br>
 They shall make known unto you all things that are done here.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (touching whom ye received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]that is called Justus, who are of the circumcision: these only are my fellow-workers unto the kingdom of Elokim, men that have been a comfort unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], saluteth you, always striving for you in his prayers, that ye may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For I bear him witness, that he hath much labor for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas salute you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Salute the brethren that are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the New Creation Masjid that is in their house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And when this epistle hath been read among you, cause that it be read also in the New Creation Masjid of the Laodiceans; and that ye also read the epistle from Laodicea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in HaAdon, that thou fulfil it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
<br>
 Remember my bonds.
<br>
 Grace be with you.
