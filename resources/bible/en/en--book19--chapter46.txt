<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah; set to Alamoth. A Song) Elokim is our refuge and strength,
<br>
A very present help in trouble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Therefore will we not fear, though the earth do change,
<br>
And though the mountains be shaken into the heart of the seas;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled,
<br>
Though the mountains tremble with the swelling thereof.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> There is a river, the streams whereof make glad the city of Elokim,
<br>
The holy place of the tabernacles of the Most High.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Elokim is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved:
<br>
Elokim will help her, and that right early.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The nations raged, the kingdoms were moved:
<br>
He uttered his voice, the earth melted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> تتراجراماتون of hosts is with us;
<br>
The Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob) is our refuge.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Come, behold the works of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
What desolations he hath made in the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth;
<br>
He breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder;
<br>
He burneth the chariots in the fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Be still, and know that I am Elokim:
<br>
I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> تتراجراماتون of hosts is with us;
<br>
The Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob) is our refuge.
<br>
Selah
