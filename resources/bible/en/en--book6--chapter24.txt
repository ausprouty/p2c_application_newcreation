<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, Your fathers dwelt of old time beyond the River, even Terah, the father of Ibrahim (Abraham), and the father of Nahor: and they served other Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And I took your father Ibrahim (Abraham) from beyond the River, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed, and gave him Ishaq (Isaac).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And I gave unto Ishaq (Isaac) Ya’qub (Jacob) and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Ya’qub (Jacob) and his children went down into Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And I sent Musa and Haron (Aaron), and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in the midst thereof: and afterward I brought you out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and with horsemen unto the Red Sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And when they cried out unto تتراجراماتون, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the wilderness many days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that dwelt beyond the Jordan: and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and ye possessed their land; and I destroyed them from before you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel: and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> but I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you still: so I delivered you out of his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And ye went over the Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And I gave you a land whereon thou hadst not labored, and cities which ye built not, and ye dwell therein; of vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Now therefore fear تتراجراماتون, and serve him in sincerity and in truth; and put away the Elokim which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt; and serve ye تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And if it seem evil unto you to serve تتراجراماتون, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the Elokim which your fathers served that were beyond the River, or the Elokim of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the people answered and said, Far be it from us that we should forsake تتراجراماتون, to serve other Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> for تتراجراماتون our Elokim, he it is that brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and that did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and تتراجراماتون drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites that dwelt in the land: therefore we also will serve تتراجراماتون; for he is our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve تتراجراماتون; for he is a holy Elokim; he is a jealous Elokim; he will not forgive your transgression nor your sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> If ye forsake تتراجراماتون, and serve foreign Elokim, then he will turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you تتراجراماتون, to serve him.
<br>
 And they said, We are witnesses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Now therefore put away, said he, the foreign Elokim which are among you, and incline your heart unto تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And the people said unto Joshua, تتراجراماتون our Elokim will we serve, and unto his voice will we hearken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of Elokim; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak that was by the sanctuary of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of تتراجراماتون which he spoke unto us: it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> So Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of تتراجراماتون, died, being a hundred and ten years old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And Israel served تتراجراماتون all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, and had known all the work of تتراجراماتون, that he had wrought for Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And the bones of Yusuf (Joseph), which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel of ground which Ya’qub (Jacob) bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money: and they became the inheritance of the children of Yusuf (Joseph).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And Eleazar the son of Haron (Aaron) died; and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill-country of Ephraim.
