<sup class="versenum">1</sup> But now thus saith تتراجراماتون that created thee, O Ya’qub (Jacob), and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For I am تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Since thou hast been precious in my sight, and honorable, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men in thy stead, and peoples instead of thy life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yea, whom I have made.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Ye are my witnesses, saith تتراجراماتون, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no Elokim formed, neither shall there be after me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I, even I, am تتراجراماتون; and besides me there is no saviour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange Elokim among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith تتراجراماتون, and I am Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Yea, since the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who can hinder it?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> I am تتراجراماتون, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> who bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as a wick): 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> The beasts of the field shall honor me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Ya’qub (Jacob); but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Thou hast not brought me of thy sheep for burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices.
<br>
 I have not burdened thee with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Thou hast bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast burdened me with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: set thou forth thy cause, that thou mayest be justified.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will make Ya’qub (Jacob) a curse, and Israel a reviling.
