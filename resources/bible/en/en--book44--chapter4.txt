<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And as they spoke unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> being sore troubled because they taught the people, and proclaimed in [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]the resurrection from the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And they laid hands on them, and put them in ward unto the morrow: for it was now eventide.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together in Jerusalem; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and Annas the high priest was there, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ruach, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> if we this day are examined concerning a good deed done to an impotent man, by what means this man is made whole; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] of Nazareth, whom ye pierced alive on the Tree, whom Elokim raised from the dead, even in him doth this man stand here before you whole.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He is the stone which was set at nought of you the builders, which was made the head of the corner.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And in none other is there salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven, that is given among men, wherein we must be saved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Now when they beheld the boldness of Peter and John, and had perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And seeing the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
<br>
  :<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been wrought through them, is manifest to all that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And they called them, and charged them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it is right in the sight of Elokim to hearken unto you rather than unto Elokim, judge ye: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> for we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they, when they had further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people; for all men glorified Elokim for that which was done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For the man was more than forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was wrought.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And being let go, they came to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and the elders had said unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And they, when they heard it, lifted up their voice to Elokim with one accord, and said, O Lord, thou that didst make the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that in them is: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> who by the Holy Ruach, by the mouth of our father David (Dawad) thy servant, didst say,
<br>
Why did the Gentiles rage,
<br>
And the peoples imagine vain things?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> The kings of the earth set themselves in array,
<br>
And the rulers were gathered together,
<br>
Against HaAdon, and against his Anointed:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> for of a truth in this city against thy holy Servant [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], whom thou didst anoint, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> to do whatsoever thy hand and thy council foreordained to come to pass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants to speak thy word with all boldness, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> while thou stretchest forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done through the name of thy holy Servant [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And when they had prayed, the place was shaken wherein they were gathered together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ruach, and they spoke the word of Elokim with boldness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and not one of them said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And with great power gave the apostles their witness of the resurrection of HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]: and great grace was upon them all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> For neither was there among them any that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> and laid them at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto each, according as any one had need.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And Yosef, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, Son of exhortation), a Levite, a man of Cyprus by race, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
