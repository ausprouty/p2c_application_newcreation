<sup class="versenum">1</sup>And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Speak unto Haron (Aaron) and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto تتراجراماتون, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> What man soever of the seed of Haron (Aaron) is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean.
<br>
 And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am تتراجراماتون who sanctifieth them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest’s, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But if a priest buy [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-:14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And if a priest’s daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto تتراجراماتون, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am تتراجراماتون who sanctifieth them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Speak unto Haron (Aaron), and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer unto تتراجراماتون for a burnt-offering; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto تتراجراماتون to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto تتراجراماتون, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto تتراجراماتون; neither shall ye do thus in your land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your Elokim of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto تتراجراماتون, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am تتراجراماتون who halloweth you, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your Elokim: I am تتراجراماتون.
