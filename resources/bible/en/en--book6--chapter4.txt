<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that تتراجراماتون spoke unto Joshua, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place, where ye shall lodge this night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of تتراجراماتون your Elokim into the midst of the Jordan, and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these stones? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> then ye shall say unto them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as تتراجراماتون spoke unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel; and they carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For the priests that bare the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that تتراجراماتون commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Musa commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of تتراجراماتون passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Musa spoke unto them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before تتراجراماتون unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> On that day تتراجراماتون magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Musa, all the days of his life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Joshua, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون were come up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests’ feet were lifted up unto the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned unto their place, and went over all its banks, as aforetime.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up in Gilgal.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he spoke unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean these stones? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For تتراجراماتون your Elokim dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as تتراجراماتون your Elokim did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over; 24</sup> that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of تتراجراماتون, that it is mighty; that ye may fear تتراجراماتون your Elokim for ever.
