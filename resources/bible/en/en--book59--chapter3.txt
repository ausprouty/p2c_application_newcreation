<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Be not many of you teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.[T.N. See Romans 2:20-24; Matthew 23:8; I Timothy 1:7 and beware of effete and pompous wealthy leaders who love their money and their titles but refuse to dirty their hands with street preaching and lowly visitation of the sick and the infirm.]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For in many things we all stumble.
<br>
 If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Now if we put the horsesâ€™ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things.
<br>
 Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> but the tongue can no man tame; it is a restless evil, it is full of deadly poison.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Therewith bless we HaAdon and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing.
<br>
 My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither can salt water yield sweet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> This wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.
