<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor,
<br>
If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth,
<br>
Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself,
<br>
Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor:
<br>
Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Give not sleep to thine eyes,
<br>
Nor slumber to thine eyelids;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter,
<br>
And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Go to the ant, thou sluggard;
<br>
Consider her ways, and be wise:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Which having no chief,
<br>
Overseer, or ruler,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Provideth her bread in the summer,
<br>
And gathereth her food in the harvest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard?
<br>
When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
<br>
A little folding of the hands to sleep:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> So shall thy poverty come as a robber,
<br>
And thy want as an armed man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> A worthless person, a man of iniquity,
<br>
Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet,
<br>
That maketh signs with his fingers;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> In whose heart is perverseness,
<br>
Who deviseth evil continually,
<br>
Who soweth discord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly;
<br>
On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> There are six things which تتراجراماتون hateth;
<br>
Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
<br>
And hands that shed innocent blood;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> A heart that deviseth wicked purposes,
<br>
Feet that are swift in running to mischief,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> A false witness that uttereth lies,
<br>
And he that soweth discord among brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> My son, keep the commandment of thy father,
<br>
And forsake not the law of thy mother:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Bind them continually upon thy heart;
<br>
Tie them about thy neck.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> When thou walkest, it shall lead thee;
<br>
When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee;
<br>
And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light;
<br>
And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> To keep thee from the evil woman,
<br>
From the flattery of the foreigner’s tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Lust not after her beauty in thy heart;
<br>
Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread;
<br>
And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Can a man take fire in his bosom,
<br>
And his clothes not be burned?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Or can one walk upon hot coals,
<br>
And his feet not be scorched?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> So he that goeth in to his neighbor’s wife;
<br>
Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Men do not despise a thief, if he steal
<br>
To satisfy himself when he is hungry:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold;
<br>
He shall give all the substance of his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding:
<br>
He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Wounds and dishonor shall he get;
<br>
And his reproach shall not be wiped away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> For jealousy is the rage of a man;
<br>
And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> He will not regard any ransom;
<br>
Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
