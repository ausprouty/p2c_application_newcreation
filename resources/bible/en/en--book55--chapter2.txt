<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The husbandman that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Consider what I say; for HaAdon shall give thee understanding in all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Remember [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], risen from the dead, of the seed of David (Dawad), according to my Holy Injil: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of Elokim is not bound.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]with eternal glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of HaAdon, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Give diligence to present thyself approved unto Elokim, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Howbeit the firm foundation of Elokim standeth, having this seal, HaAdon knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of HaAdon depart from unrighteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on HaAdon out of a pure heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And HaAdon’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure Elokim may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.
