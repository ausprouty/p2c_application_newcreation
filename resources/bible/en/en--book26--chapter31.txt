<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude: Whom art thou like in thy greatness? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature; and its top was among the thick boughs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow: the rivers thereof ran round about its plantation; and it sent out its channels unto all the trees of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field; and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long by reason of many waters, when it shot them forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> All the birds of the heavens made their nests in its boughs; and under its branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young; and under its shadow dwelt all great nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Thus was it fair in its greatness, in the length of its branches; for its root was by many waters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The cedars in the garden of Elokim could not hide it; the fir-trees were not like its boughs, and the plane-trees were not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of Elokim like unto it in its beauty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I made it fair by the multitude of its branches, so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of Elokim, envied it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Therefore thus said HaAdon تتراجراماتون: Because thou art exalted in stature, and he hath set his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven him out for his wickedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Upon his ruin all the birds of the heavens shall dwell, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs, nor that their mighty ones stand up in their height, even all that drink water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the rivers thereof; and the great waters were stayed; and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with them that descend into the pit; and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, were comforted in the nether parts of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> They also went down into Sheol with him unto them that are slain by the sword; yea, they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword.
<br>
 This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون.
