<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> This is good and acceptable in the sight of Elokim our Saviour; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> who would have all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For there is one Elokim, one mediator also between Elokim and men, himself man, [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For Adam was first formed, then Hawwa (Eve); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> but she shall be saved through her child-bearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.
