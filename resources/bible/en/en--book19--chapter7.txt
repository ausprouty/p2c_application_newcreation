<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (Shiggaion of Dawad, which he sang unto تتراجراماتون, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite.) O تتراجراماتون my Elokim, in thee do I take refuge:
<br>
Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Lest they tear my soul like a lion,
<br>
Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> O تتراجراماتون my Elokim, if I have done this;
<br>
If there be iniquity in my hands;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me
<br>
(Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary;)
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it;
<br>
Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth,
<br>
And lay my glory in the dust.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Arise, O تتراجراماتون, in thine anger;
<br>
Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries,
<br>
And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about;
<br>
And over them return thou on high.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> تتراجراماتون ministereth judgment to the peoples:
<br>
Judge me, O تتراجراماتون, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous:
<br>
For the righteous Elokim trieth the minds and hearts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> My shield is with Elokim,
<br>
Who saveth the upright in heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Elokim is a righteous judge,
<br>
Yea, a Elokim that hath indignation every day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> If a man turn not, he will whet his sword;
<br>
He hath bent his bow, and made it ready;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death;
<br>
He maketh his arrows fiery shafts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity;
<br>
Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> He hath made a pit, and digged it,
<br>
And is fallen into the ditch which he made.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> His mischief shall return upon his own head,
<br>
And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> I will give thanks unto تتراجراماتون according to his righteousness,
<br>
And will sing praise to the name of تتراجراماتون Most High.
