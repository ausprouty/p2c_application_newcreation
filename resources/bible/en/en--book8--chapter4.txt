<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there: and, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.
<br>
 And he turned aside, and sat down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here.
<br>
 And they sat down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he said unto the near kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the country of Moab, selleth the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and I thought to disclose it unto thee, saying, Buy [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] it before them that sit here, and before the elders of my people.
<br>
 If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee.
<br>
 And he said, I will redeem it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar mine own inheritance: take thou my right of redemption on thee; for I cannot redeem it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the manner of attestation in Israel.
<br>
[T.N. The right to purchase was forfeited by relinquishing a sandal.  The exchange was made with silver and gold.  The Go'el Redeemer becomes the substitute for the sake of the living and the dead so that life can carry on.  The death of the Lamb of the Passover is so that the Redeemed can go to life.  The Lamb Messiah Redeemer went to his death so that we can go to life, but we were redeemed not by Boaz's silver and gold but by the blood of the Lamb (I Peter 1:18-20; Isaiah 53:1-12).  This Go'el from Judah is an ancestor of David the King and Ben David our Redeemer and King. See I Chronicles 2:4; 3:5; Matthew 1:1-25; Luke 3:23-38.]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> So the near kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. تتراجراماتون make the woman that is come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and let thy house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bare unto Judah, of the seed which تتراجراماتون shall give thee of this young woman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in unto her, and تتراجراماتون gave her conception, and she bare a son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be تتراجراماتون, who hath not left thee this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he shall be unto thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse unto it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begat Hezron, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David (Dawad).
