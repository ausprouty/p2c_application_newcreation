<sup class="versenum">1</sup> O تتراجراماتون, thou art my Elokim; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For thou hast made of a city a heap, of a fortified city a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Therefore shall a strong people glorify thee; a city of terrible nations shall fear thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For thou hast been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> As the heat in a dry place wilt thou bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And in this mountain will تتراجراماتون of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that covereth all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He hath swallowed up death for ever; and HaAdon تتراجراماتون will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people will he take away from off all the earth: for تتراجراماتون hath spoken it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our Elokim; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is تتراجراماتون; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For in this mountain will the hand of تتراجراماتون rest; and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim; but تتراجراماتون will lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And the high fortress of thy walls hath he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.
