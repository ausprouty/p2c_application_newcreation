<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the first-ripe fig.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The Godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge is ready for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the evil desire of his soul: thus they weave it together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Trust ye not in a neighbor; put ye not confidence in a friend; keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For the son dishonoreth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But as for me, I will look unto تتراجراماتون; I will wait for the Elokim of my salvation: my Elokim will hear me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, تتراجراماتون will be a light unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I will bear the indignation of تتراجراماتون, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is تتراجراماتون thy Elokim? Mine eyes shall see my desire upon her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> In that day shall they come unto thee from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I show unto them marvellous things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might; they shall lay their hand upon their mouth; their ears shall be deaf.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places; they shall come with fear unto تتراجراماتون our Elokim, and shall be afraid because of thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Who is a Elokim like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth over the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in lovingkindness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He will again have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot; and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Thou wilt perform the truth to Ya’qub (Jacob), and the lovingkindness to Ibrahim (Abraham), which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.
