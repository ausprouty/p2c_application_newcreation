<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was there:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And when the wine failed, the mother of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto him, They have no wine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews’ manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water.
<br>
 And they filled them up to the brim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast.
<br>
 And they bare it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when men have drunk freely, then that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> This beginning of his signs did [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]went up to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But he spoke of the temple of his body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spoke this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]had said.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.
