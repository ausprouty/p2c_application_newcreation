<sup class="versenum">1</sup> After these things [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested himself on this wise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing.
<br>
 They say unto him, We also come with thee.
<br>
 They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But when day was now breaking, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find.
<br>
 They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> That disciple therefore whom [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]loved saith unto Peter, It is HaAdon.
<br>
 So when Simon Peter heard that it was HaAdon, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net full of fishes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, Come and break your fast.
<br>
 And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> This is now the third time that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So when they had broken their fast, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.
<br>
 He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> He saith to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee.
<br>
 He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee.
<br>
 [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Now this he spoke, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify Elokim.
<br>
 And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]loved following; who also leaned back on his chest at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Peter therefore seeing him saith to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], Lord, and what shall this man do? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And there are also many other things which [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.
