<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Dawad). The king shall joy in thy strength, O تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thou hast given him his heart’s desire,
<br>
And hast not withholden the request of his lips.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For thou meetest him with the blessings of goodness:
<br>
Thou settest a crown of fine gold on his head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He asked life of thee, thou gavest it him,
<br>
Even length of days for ever and ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> His glory is great in thy salvation:
<br>
Honor and majesty dost thou lay upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For thou makest him most blessed for ever:
<br>
Thou makest him glad with joy in thy presence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For the king trusteth in تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And through the lovingkindness of the Most High he shall not be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Thy hand will find out all thine enemies;
<br>
Thy right hand will find out those that hate thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thou wilt make them as a fiery furnace in the time of thine anger:
<br>
تتراجراماتون will swallow them up in his wrath,
<br>
And the fire shall devour them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Their fruit wilt thou destroy from the earth,
<br>
And their seed from among the children of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For they intended evil against thee;
<br>
They conceived a device which they are not able to perform.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For thou wilt make them turn their back;
<br>
Thou wilt make ready with thy bowstrings against their face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Be thou exalted, O تتراجراماتون, in thy strength:
<br>
So will we sing and praise thy power.
