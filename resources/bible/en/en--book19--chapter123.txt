<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Song of Ascents) Unto thee do I lift up mine eyes,
<br>
O thou that sittest in the heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their master,
<br>
As the eyes of a maid unto the hand of her mistress;
<br>
So our eyes look unto تتراجراماتون our Elokim,
<br>
Until he have mercy upon us.

<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Have mercy upon us, O تتراجراماتون, have mercy upon us;
<br>
For we are exceedingly filled with contempt.

<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Our soul is exceedingly filled
<br>
With the scoffing of those that are at ease,
<br>
And with the contempt of the proud.
