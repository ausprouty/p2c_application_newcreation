<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now David (Dawad) was old and full of days; and he made Solomon his son king over Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the priests and the Levites.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the Levites were numbered from thirty years old and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Of these, twenty and four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of تتراجراماتون; and six thousand were officers and judges; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and four thousand were doorkeepers; and four thousand praised تتراجراماتون with the instruments which I made, said David (Dawad), to praise therewith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And David (Dawad) divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Of the Gershonites: Ladan and Shimei.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, and Zetham, and Joel, three.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
<br>
 These were the heads of the fathers’ houses of Ladan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah.
<br>
 These four were the sons of Shimei.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they became a fathers’ house in one reckoning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The sons of Kohath: ‘Imran (Amram), Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The sons of ‘Imran (Amram): Haron (Aaron) and Musa; and Haron (Aaron) was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons, for ever, to burn incense before تتراجراماتون, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name, for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But as for Musa the man of Elokim, his sons were named among the tribe of Levi.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The sons of Musa: Gershom and Eliezer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The sons of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the sons of Eliezer were: Rehabiah the chief; and Eliezer had no other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The sons of Izhar: Shelomith the chief.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The sons of Hebron: Jeriah the chief, Amariah the second, Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> The sons of Uzziel: Micah the chief, and Isshiah the second.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi.
<br>
 The sons of Mahli: Eleazar and Kish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters only: and their brethren the sons of Kish took them to wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> These were the sons of Levi after their fathers’ houses, even the heads of the fathers’ houses of those of them that were counted, in the number of names by their polls, who did the work for the service of the house of تتراجراماتون, from twenty years old and upward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For David (Dawad) said, تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, hath given rest unto his people; and he dwelleth in Jerusalem for ever:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and also the Levites shall no more have need to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels of it for the service thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For by the last words of David (Dawad) the sons of Levi were numbered, from twenty years old and upward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> For their office was to wait on the sons of Haron (Aaron) for the service of the house of تتراجراماتون, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, even the work of the service of the house of Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> for the showbread also, and for the fine flour for a meal-offering, whether of unleavened wafers, or of that which is baked in the pan, or of that which is soaked, and for all manner of measure and size; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> and to stand every morning to thank and praise تتراجراماتون, and likewise at even; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> and to offer all burnt-offerings unto تتراجراماتون, on the sabbaths, on the new moons, and on the set feasts, in number according to the ordinance concerning them, continually before تتراجراماتون; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> and that they should keep the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge of the sons of Haron (Aaron) their brethren, for the service of the house of تتراجراماتون.
