<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Hear, my sons, the instruction of a father,
<br>
And attend to know understanding:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For I give you good doctrine;
<br>
Forsake ye not my law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For I was a son unto my father,
<br>
Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he taught me, and said unto me:
<br>
Let thy heart retain my words;
<br>
Keep my commandments, and live;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Get [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] wisdom, get understanding;
<br>
Forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Forsake her not, and she will preserve thee;
<br>
Love her, and she will keep thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] wisdom; Yea, with all thy getting get understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Exalt her, and she will promote thee;
<br>
She will bring thee to honor, when thou dost embrace her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> She will give to thy head a chaplet of grace;
<br>
A crown of beauty will she deliver to thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;
<br>
And the years of thy life shall be many.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I have taught thee in the way of wisdom;
<br>
I have led thee in paths of uprightness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened;
<br>
And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go:
<br>
Keep her; for she is thy life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Enter not into the path of the wicked,
<br>
And walk not in the way of evil men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Avoid it, pass not by it;
<br>
Turn from it, and pass on.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For they sleep not, except they do evil;
<br>
And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For they eat the bread of wickedness,
<br>
And drink the wine of violence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But the path of the righteous is as the dawning light,
<br>
That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The way of the wicked is as darkness:
<br>
They know not at what they stumble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> My son, attend to my words;
<br>
Incline thine ear unto my sayings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Let them not depart from thine eyes;
<br>
Keep them in the midst of thy heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For they are life unto those that find them,
<br>
And health to all their flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Keep thy heart with all diligence;
<br>
For out of it are the issues of life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Put away from thee a wayward mouth,
<br>
And perverse lips put far from thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Let thine eyes look right on,
<br>
And let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Make level the path of thy feet,
<br>
And let all thy ways be established.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Turn not to the right hand nor to the left:
<br>
Remove thy foot from evil.
