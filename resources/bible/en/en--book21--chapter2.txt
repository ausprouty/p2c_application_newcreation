<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also was vanity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I said of laughter, It is mad; and of mirth, What doeth it? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I searched in my heart how to cheer my flesh with wine, my heart yet guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what it was good for the sons of men that they should do under heaven all the days of their life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me vineyards; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I made me gardens and parks, and I planted trees in them of all kinds of fruit; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I made me pools of water, to water therefrom the forest where trees were reared; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] men-servants and maid-servants, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of herds and flocks, above all that were before me in Jerusalem; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I gathered me also silver and gold, and the treasure of kings and of the provinces; I gat me men-singers and women-singers, and the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and that of all sorts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them; I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced because of all my labor; and this was my portion from all my labor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and on the labor that I had labored to do; and, behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was no profit under the sun.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that which hath been done long ago.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light excelleth darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The wise man’s eyes are in his head, and the fool walketh in darkness: and yet I perceived that one event happeneth to them all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so will it happen even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then said I in my heart, that this also is vanity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For of the wise man, even as of the fool, there is no remembrance for ever; seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten.
<br>
 And how doth the wise man die even as the fool! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> So I hated life, because the work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all is vanity and a striving after wind.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And I hated all my labor wherein I labored under the sun, seeing that I must leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And who knoweth whether he will be a wise man or a fool? yet will he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun.
<br>
 This also is vanity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Therefore I turned about to cause my heart to despair concerning all the labor wherein I had labored under the sun.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For there is a man whose labor is with wisdom, and with knowledge, and with skilfulness; yet to a man that hath not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion.
<br>
 This also is vanity and a great evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For what hath a man of all his labor, and of the striving of his heart, wherein he laboreth under the sun? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For all his days are but sorrows, and his travail is grief; yea, even in the night his heart taketh no rest.
<br>
 This also is vanity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink, and make his soul enjoy good in his labor.
<br>
 This also I saw, that it is from the hand of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For who can eat, or who can have enjoyment, more than I? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For to the man that pleaseth him Elokim giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; but to the sinner he giveth travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that pleaseth Elokim. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
