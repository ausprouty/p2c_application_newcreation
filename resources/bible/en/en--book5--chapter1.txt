<sup class="versenum">1</sup> These are the words which Musa spoke unto all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-zahab.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Musa spoke unto the children of Israel, according unto all that تتراجراماتون had given him in commandment unto them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> after he had smitten Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Musa to declare this law, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> تتراجراماتون our Elokim spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the sea-shore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which تتراجراماتون sware unto your fathers, to Ibrahim (Abraham), to Ishaq (Isaac), and to Ya’qub (Jacob), to give unto them and to their seed after them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> تتراجراماتون your Elokim hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Take you wise men, and understanding, and known, according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the sojourner that is with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; ye shall hear the small and the great alike; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is Elokim’s: and the cause that is too hard for you ye shall bring unto me, and I will hear it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And we journeyed from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw, by the way to the hill-country of the Amorites, as تتراجراماتون our Elokim commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the hill-country of the Amorites, which تتراجراماتون our Elokim giveth unto us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Behold, تتراجراماتون thy Elokim hath set the land before thee: go up, take possession, as تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of thy fathers, hath spoken unto thee; fear not, neither be dismayed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities unto which we shall come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And the thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and they turned and went up into the hill-country, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land which تتراجراماتون our Elokim giveth unto us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of تتراجراماتون your Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> and ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because تتراجراماتون hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Whither are we going up? our brethren have made our heart to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> تتراجراماتون your Elokim who goeth before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> and in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that تتراجراماتون thy Elokim bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came unto this place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Yet in this thing ye did not believe تتراجراماتون your Elokim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and in the cloud by day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And تتراجراماتون heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Also تتراجراماتون was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Joshua the son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage thou him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> Moreover your little ones, that ye said should be a prey, and your children, that this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against تتراجراماتون, we will go up and fight, according to all that تتراجراماتون our Elokim commanded us.
<br>
 And ye girded on every man his weapons of war, and were forward to go up into the hill-country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> So I spoke unto you, and ye hearkened not; but ye rebelled against the commandment of تتراجراماتون, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill-country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And the Amorites, that dwelt in that hill-country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even unto Hormah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And ye returned and wept before تتراجراماتون; but تتراجراماتون hearkened not to your voice, nor gave ear unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.
