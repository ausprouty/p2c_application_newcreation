<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And on the seventh day Elokim finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Elokim blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it he rested from all his work which Elokim had created and made.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that تتراجراماتون Elokim made earth and heaven. [T.N. Tetragrammaton in Arabic, so used throughout the NCM translation, is the four Hebrew letters that constitute the proper Name of GOD.]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up; for تتراجراماتون Elokim had not caused it to rain upon the earth: and there was not a man to till the ground;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup></sup> And تتراجراماتون Elokim formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup></sup> And تتراجراماتون Elokim planted a garden eastward, in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup></sup> And out of the ground made تتراجراماتون Elokim to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four heads.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The name of the first is Pishon: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Cush.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And تتراجراماتون Elokim took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And تتراجراماتون Elokim commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And تتراجراماتون Elokim said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And out of the ground تتراجراماتون Elokim formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens; and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them: and whatsoever the man called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but for man there was not found a help meet for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And تتراجراماتون Elokim caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> and the rib, which تتراجراماتون Elokim had taken from the man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
