<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Rejoice in تتراجراماتون, O ye righteous:
<br>
Praise is comely for the upright.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Give thanks unto تتراجراماتون with the harp:
<br>
Sing praises unto him with the psaltery of ten strings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Sing unto him a new song;
<br>
Play skilfully with a loud noise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For the word of تتراجراماتون is right;
<br>
And all his work is done in faithfulness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> He loveth righteousness and justice:
<br>
The earth is full of the lovingkindness of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> By the word of تتراجراماتون were the heavens made,
<br>
And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap:
<br>
He layeth up the deeps in store-houses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Let all the earth fear تتراجراماتون:
<br>
Let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For he spoke, and it was done;
<br>
He commanded, and it stood fast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> تتراجراماتون bringeth the counsel of the nations to nought;
<br>
He maketh the thoughts of the peoples to be of no effect.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The counsel of تتراجراماتون standeth fast for ever,
<br>
The thoughts of his heart to all generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Blessed is the nation whose Elokim is تتراجراماتون,
<br>
The people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> تتراجراماتون looketh from heaven;
<br>
He beholdeth all the sons of men;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> From the place of his habitation he looketh forth
<br>
Upon all the inhabitants of the earth,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> He that fashioneth the hearts of them all,
<br>
That considereth all their works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> There is no king saved by the multitude of a host:
<br>
A mighty man is not delivered by great strength.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> A horse is a vain thing for safety;
<br>
Neither doth he deliver any by his great power.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Behold, the eye of تتراجراماتون is upon them that fear him,
<br>
Upon them that hope in his lovingkindness;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> To deliver their soul from death,
<br>
And to keep them alive in famine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Our soul hath waited for تتراجراماتون:
<br>
He is our help and our shield.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For our heart shall rejoice in him,
<br>
Because we have trusted in his holy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Let thy lovingkindness, O تتراجراماتون, be upon us,
<br>
According as we have hoped in thee.
