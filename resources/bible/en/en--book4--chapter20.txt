<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Musa and against Haron (Aaron).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the people strove with Musa, and spoke, saying, Would that we had died when our brethren died before تتراجراماتون! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And why have ye brought the assembly of تتراجراماتون into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tent of meeting, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of تتراجراماتون appeared unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, thou, and Haron (Aaron) thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their cattle drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Musa took the rod from before تتراجراماتون, as he commanded him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; shall we bring you forth water out of this rock? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Musa lifted up his hand, and smote the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their cattle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa and Haron (Aaron), Because ye believed not in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with تتراجراماتون, and he was sanctified in them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Musa sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and when we cried unto تتراجراماتون, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells; we will go along the king’s highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy border.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of thy water, I and my cattle, then will I give the price thereof: let me only, without doing anything else, pass through on my feet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he said, Thou shalt not pass through.
<br>
 And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And they journeyed from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came unto mount Hor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa and Haron (Aaron) in mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Haron (Aaron) shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Take Haron (Aaron) and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and strip Haron (Aaron) of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Haron (Aaron) shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Musa did as تتراجراماتون commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Musa stripped Haron (Aaron) of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Haron (Aaron) died there on the top of the mount: and Musa and Eleazar came down from the mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And when all the congregation saw that Haron (Aaron) was dead, they wept for Haron (Aaron) thirty days, even all the house of Israel.
