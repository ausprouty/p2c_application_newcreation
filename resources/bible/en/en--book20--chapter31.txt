<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> What, my son? and what, O son of my womb?
<br>
And what, O son of my vows?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Give not thy strength unto women,
<br>
Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine;
<br>
Nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Lest they drink, and forget the law,
<br>
And pervert the justice due to any that is afflicted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,
<br>
And wine unto the bitter in soul:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Let him drink, and forget his poverty,
<br>
And remember his misery no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Open thy mouth for the dumb,
<br>
In the cause of all such as are left desolate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Open thy mouth, judge righteously,
<br>
And minister justice to the poor and needy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> A worthy woman who can find?
<br>
For her price is far above rubies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The heart of her husband trusteth in her,
<br>
And he shall have no lack of gain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> She doeth him good and not evil
<br>
All the days of her life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> She seeketh wool and flax,
<br>
And worketh willingly with her hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> She is like the merchant-ships;
<br>
She bringeth her bread from afar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> She riseth also while it is yet night,
<br>
And giveth food to her household,
<br>
And their task to her maidens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> She considereth a field, and buyeth it;
<br>
With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> She girdeth her loins with strength,
<br>
And maketh strong her arms.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable;
<br>
Her lamp goeth not out by night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> She layeth her hands to the distaff,
<br>
And her hands hold the spindle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> She stretcheth out her hand to the poor;
<br>
Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> She is not afraid of the snow for her household;
<br>
For all her household are clothed with scarlet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry;
<br>
Her clothing is fine linen and purple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Her husband is known in the gates,
<br>
When he sitteth among the elders of the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> She maketh linen garments and selleth them,
<br>
And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Strength and dignity are her clothing;
<br>
And she laugheth at the time to come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> She openeth her mouth with wisdom;
<br>
And the law of kindness is on her tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> She looketh well to the ways of her household,
<br>
And eateth not the bread of idleness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Her children rise up, and call her blessed;
<br>
Her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Many daughters have done worthily,
<br>
But thou excellest them all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain;
<br>
But a woman that feareth تتراجراماتون, she shall be praised.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Give her of the fruit of her hands;
<br>
And let her works praise her in the gates.
