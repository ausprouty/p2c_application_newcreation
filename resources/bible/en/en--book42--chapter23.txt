<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the whole company of them rose up, and brought him before Pilate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he himself is al-Masih a king.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Pilate said unto the chief priests and the multitudes, I find no fault in this man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But they were the more urgent, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, and beginning from Galilee even unto this place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But when Pilate heard it, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And when he knew that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him unto Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in these days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Now when Herod saw [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], he was exceeding glad: for he was of a long time desirous to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he questioned him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Herod with his soldiers set him at nought, and mocked him, and arraying him in gorgeous apparel sent him back to Pilate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and said unto them, Ye brought unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people: and behold, I, having examined him before you, found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> no, nor yet Herod: for he sent him back unto us; and behold, nothing worthy of death hath been done by him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Now he was obliged to release to them one at the Festival. 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But they cried out all together, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:’ 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> one who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Pilate spoke unto them again, desiring to release [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> but they shouted, saying, Pierce alive on the Tree [see 2Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid (Son of David) pierced hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a mevaser announcer of Good News of al-Salaam (2 Timothy 4:5) to herald it; see Psalm :22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5], pierced him alive on a Tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath this man done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him and release him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be pierced alive on the Tree. And their voices prevailed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Pilate gave sentence that what they asked for should be done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And he released him that for insurrection and murder had been cast into prison, whom they asked for; but [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]he delivered up to their will.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And when they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the Tree, to bear it after [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And there followed him a great multitude of the people, and of women who bewailed and lamented him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the breasts that never gave suck.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And when they came unto the place which is called The skull, there they pierced alive on the Tree him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand and the other on the left.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.
<br>
 And parting his garments among them, they cast lots.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And the people stood beholding.
<br>
 And the rulers also scoffed at him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if this is [Bar Enosh] al-Masih of [Atik Yomin] Elokim, his chosen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, offering him vinegar, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> and saying, If thou art the King of the Jews, save thyself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And there was also a superscription over him, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And one of the malefactors that were hanged railed on him, saying, Art not thou al-Masih? save thyself and us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> But the other answered, and rebuking him said, Dost thou not even fear Elokim, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And he said, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], remember me when thou comest in thy kingdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And he said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And it was now about the sixth hour, and a darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> the light of the sun failing: and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], crying with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said this, he gave up the ghost.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified Elokim, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And all the multitudes that came together to this sight, when they beheld the things that were done, returned smiting their breasts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed with him from Galilee, stood afar off, seeing these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And behold, a man named Yosef, who was a councillor, a good and righteous man 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), a man of Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who was looking for the kingdom of Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> this man went to Pilate, and asked for the body of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> And he took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was hewn in stone, where never man had yet lain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> And it was the day of the Preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> And the women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and beheld the tomb, and how his body was laid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments.
<br>
And on the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
