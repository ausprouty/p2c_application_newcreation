<sup class="versenum">1</sup>And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Speak unto the priests, the sons of Haron (Aaron), and say unto them, There shall none defile himself for the dead among his people;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> except for his kin, that is near unto him, for his mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his daughter, and for his brother, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and for his sister a virgin, that is near unto him, that hath had no husband; for her may he defile himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people, to profane himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> They shall be holy unto their Elokim, and not profane the name of their Elokim; for the offerings of تتراجراماتون made by fire, the bread of their Elokim, they do offer: therefore they shall be holy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> They shall not take a woman that is a harlot, or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for he is holy unto his Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread of thy Elokim: he shall be holy unto thee; for I تتراجراماتون, who sanctify you, am holy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by playing the harlot, she profaneth her father: she shall be burnt with fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head go loose, nor rend his clothes; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father, or for his mother; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his Elokim; for the crown of the anointing oil of his Elokim is upon him: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> A widow, or one divorced, or a profane woman, a harlot, these shall he not take: but a virgin of his own people shall he take to wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he shall not profane his seed among his people: for I am تتراجراماتون who sanctifieth him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Speak unto Haron (Aaron), saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed throughout their generations that hath a blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose, or anything superfluous, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> or a man that is broken-footed, or broken-handed, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> or crook-backed, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye, or is scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> no man of the seed of Haron (Aaron) the priest, that hath a blemish, shall come nigh to offer the offerings of تتراجراماتون made by fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the bread of his Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> He shall eat the bread of his Elokim, both of the most holy, and of the holy: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> only he shall not go in unto the veil, nor come nigh unto the altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my sanctuaries: for I am تتراجراماتون who sanctifieth them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> So Musa spoke unto Haron (Aaron), and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel.
