<sup class="versenum">1</sup> These things spoke [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may glorify thee [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)]:

<sup class="versenum">2</sup> even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that to all whom thou hast given him, he should give eternal life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true Elokim, and him whom thou didst send, even [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And now, Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received them, and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee.
<br>
 Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we are.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we are one; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Father, I desire that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.
