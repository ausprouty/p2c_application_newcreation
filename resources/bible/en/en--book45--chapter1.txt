<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, a servant of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], called to be an apostle, separated unto the Holy Injil of Elokim,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> which he promised afore through his prophets in the holy scriptures, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> concerning his [Bar Enosh] Son, who was born of the seed of David (Dawad) according to the flesh, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> who was declared to be the [Bar Enosh] Son of [the Atik Yomin] Elokim with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead; even [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] Adoneinu [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> through whom we received grace and apostleship, unto obedience of faith among all the nations, for his name’s sake; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> among whom are ye also, called to be [Prophet] Isa al-Masih’s [pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> to all that are in Rome, beloved of Elokim, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from Elokim our Father and HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> First, I thank my Elokim through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] for you all, that your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For Elokim is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the Holy Injil of his [Bar Enosh] Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> making request, if by any means now at length I may be prospered by the will of Elokim to come unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> that is, that I with you may be comforted in you, each of us by the other’s faith, both yours and mine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you (and was hindered hitherto), that I might have some fruit in you also, even as in the rest of the Gentiles.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I am debtor both to Greeks and to Barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the Holy Injil to you also that are in Rome.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For I am not ashamed of the Holy Injil: for it is the power of Elokim unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For therein is revealed a righteousness of Elokim from faith unto faith: as it is written, But the righteous shall live by faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For the wrath of Elokim is revealed from heaven against all unungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hinder the truth in unrighteousness; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> because that which is known of Elokim is manifest in them; for Elokim manifested it unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For the invisible things of him since the creation of the world are clearly seen, being perceived through the things that are made, even his everlasting power and divinity; that they may be without excuse: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> because that, knowing Elokim, they glorified him not as Elokim, neither gave thanks; but became vain in their reasonings, and their senseless heart was darkened.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and changed the glory of the incorruptible Elokim for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Wherefore Elokim gave them up in the lusts of their hearts unto uncleanness, that their bodies should be dishonored among themselves: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> for that they exchanged the truth of Elokim for a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For this cause Elokim gave them up unto vile passions: for their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> and likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another, men with men working unseemliness, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And even as they refused to have Elokim in their knowledge, Elokim gave them up unto a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity; whisperers, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> backbiters, hateful to Elokim, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> without understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affection, unmerciful: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> who, knowing the ordinance of Elokim, that they that practise such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but also consent with them that practise them.
