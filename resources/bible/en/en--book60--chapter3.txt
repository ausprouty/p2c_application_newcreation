<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> beholding your chaste behavior coupled with fear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of Elokim of great price.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in Elokim, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> as Sarah obeyed Ibrahim (Abraham), calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Finally, be ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For,
<br>
He that would love life,
<br>
And see good days,
<br>
Let him refrain his tongue from evil,
<br>
And his lips that they speak no guile:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And let him turn away from evil, and do good;
<br>
Let him seek peace, and pursue it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For the eyes of HaAdon are upon the righteous,
<br>
And his ears unto their supplication:
<br>
But the face of HaAdon is upon them that do evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But even if ye should suffer for righteousness’ sake, blessed are ye: and fear not their fear, neither be troubled; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> but sanctify in your hearts al-Masih as HaAdon: being ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For it is better, if the will of Elokim should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Because al-Masih also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to Elokim; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of Elokim waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> which also after a true likeness doth now save you, even total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3), not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward Elokim, through the resurrection of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> who is on the right hand of Elokim, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him [T.N. See Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41].
