<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest,
<br>
So honor is not seemly for a fool.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> As the sparrow in her wandering, as the swallow in her flying,
<br>
So the curse that is causeless alighteth not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass,
<br>
And a rod for the back of fools.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Answer not a fool according to his folly,
<br>
Lest thou also be like unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Answer a fool according to his folly,
<br>
Lest he be wise in his own conceit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool
<br>
Cutteth off his own feet, and drinketh in damage.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The legs of the lame hang loose;
<br>
So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> As one that bindeth a stone in a sling,
<br>
So is he that giveth honor to a fool.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> As a thorn that goeth up into the hand of a drunkard,
<br>
So is a parable in the mouth of fools.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> As an archer that woundeth all,
<br>
So is he that hireth a fool and he that hireth them that pass by.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> As a dog that returneth to his vomit,
<br>
So is a fool that repeateth his folly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?
<br>
There is more hope of a fool than of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The sluggard saith, There is a lion in the way;
<br>
A lion is in the streets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> As the door turneth upon its hinges,
<br>
So doth the sluggard upon his bed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish;
<br>
It wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit
<br>
Than seven men that can render a reason.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He that passeth by, and vexeth himself with strife belonging not to him,
<br>
Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> As a madman who casteth firebrands,
<br>
Arrows, and death,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> So is the man that deceiveth his neighbor,
<br>
And saith, Am not I in sport?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For lack of wood the fire goeth out;
<br>
And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire,
<br>
So is a contentious man to inflame strife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels,
<br>
And they go down into the innermost parts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Fervent lips and a wicked heart
<br>
Are like an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> He that hateth dissembleth with his lips;
<br>
But he layeth up deceit within him:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> When he speaketh fair, believe him not;
<br>
For there are seven abominations in his heart:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Though his hatred cover itself with guile,
<br>
His wickedness shall be openly showed before the assembly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein;
<br>
And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> A lying tongue hateth those whom it hath wounded;
<br>
And a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
