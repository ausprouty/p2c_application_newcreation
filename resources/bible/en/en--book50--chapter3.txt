<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Finally, my brethren, rejoice in HaAdon.
<br>
 To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of Elokim, and glory in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], and have no confidence in the flesh: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> as touching zeal, persecuting the New Creation Masjid; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] Adoni: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Al-Masih, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, even that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Al-Masih, the righteousness which is from Elokim by faith: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Brethren, I count not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing I do, forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of Elokim in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall Elokim reveal unto you: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> only, whereunto we have attained, by that same rule let us walk.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the Tree of al-Masih: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> whose end is perdition, whose Elokim is the belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, that it may be conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.
