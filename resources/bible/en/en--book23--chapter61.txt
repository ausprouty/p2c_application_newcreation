<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The Spirit of HaAdon تتراجراماتون is upon me; because تتراجراماتون hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> to proclaim the year of تتراجراماتون’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our Elokim; to comfort all that mourn; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be called trees of righteousness, the planting of تتراجراماتون, that he may be glorified.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners shall be your plowmen and your vine-dressers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But ye shall be named the priests of تتراجراماتون; men shall call you the ministers of our Elokim: ye shall eat the wealth of the nations, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Instead of your shame ye shall have double; and instead of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess double; everlasting joy shall be unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For I, تتراجراماتون, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity; and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring among the peoples; all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which تتراجراماتون hath blessed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I will greatly rejoice in تتراجراماتون, my soul shall be joyful in my Elokim; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with a garland, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For as the earth bringeth forth its bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so HaAdon تتراجراماتون will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
