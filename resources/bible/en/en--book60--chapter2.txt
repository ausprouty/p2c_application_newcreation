<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> if ye have tasted that HaAdon is gracious: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with Elokim elect, precious, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to Elokim through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Because it is contained in scripture,
<br>
Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious:
<br>
And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For you therefore that believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve,
<br>
The stone which the builders rejected,
<br>
The same was made the head of the corner;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and,
<br>
A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence;
<br>
for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for Elokim’s own possession, that ye may show forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> who in time past were no people, but now are the people of Elokim: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> having your behavior seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify Elokim in the day of visitation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Be subject to every ordinance of man for HaAdon’s sake: whether to the king, as supreme; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For so is the will of Elokim, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> as free, and not using your freedom for a cloak of wickedness, but as bondservants of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Honor all men.
<br>
 Love the brotherhood.
<br>
 Fear Elokim.
<br>
 Honor the king.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward Elokim a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted for it, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For hereunto were ye called: because al-Masih also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
