<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he went up thence against the inhabitants of Debir: now the name of Debir beforetime was Kiriath-sepher.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And it came to pass, when she came unto him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she alighted from off her ass; and Caleb said, What wouldest thou? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And she said, Give me a blessing; for that thou hast set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.
<br>
 And he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.
