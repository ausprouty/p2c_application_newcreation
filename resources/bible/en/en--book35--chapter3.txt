<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, set to Shigionoth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> O تتراجراماتون, I have heard the report of thee, and am afraid:
<br>
O تتراجراماتون, revive thy work in the midst of the years;
<br>
In the midst of the years make it known;
<br>
In wrath remember mercy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Elokim came from Teman,
<br>
And the Holy One from mount Paran.
<br>
Selah.
<br>
His glory covered the heavens,
<br>
And the earth was full of his praise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And his brightness was as the light;
<br>
He had rays coming forth from his hand;
<br>
And there was the hiding of his power.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Before him went the pestilence,
<br>
And fiery bolts went forth at his feet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He stood, and measured the earth;
<br>
He beheld, and drove asunder the nations;
<br>
And the eternal mountains were scattered;
<br>
The everlasting hills did bow;
<br>
His goings were as of old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction;
<br>
The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Was تتراجراماتون displeased with the rivers?
<br>
Was thine anger against the rivers,
<br>
Or thy wrath against the sea,
<br>
That thou didst ride upon thy horses,
<br>
Upon thy chariots of salvation?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thy bow was made quite bare;
<br>
The oaths to the tribes were a sure word.
<br>
Selah.
<br>
Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The mountains saw thee, and were afraid;
<br>
The tempest of waters passed by;
<br>
The deep uttered its voice,
<br>
And lifted up its hands on high.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The sun and moon stood still in their habitation,
<br>
At the light of thine arrows as they went,
<br>
At the shining of thy glittering spear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Thou didst march though the land in indignation;
<br>
Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people,
<br>
For the salvation of thine anointed;
<br>
Thou woundest the head out of the house of the wicked man,
<br>
Laying bare the foundation even unto the neck.
<br>
Selah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thou didst pierce with his own staves the head of his warriors:
<br>
They came as a whirlwind to scatter me;
<br>
Their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thou didst tread the sea with thy horses,
<br>
The heap of mighty waters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I heard, and my body trembled,
<br>
My lips quivered at the voice;
<br>
Rottenness entereth into my bones, and I tremble in my place;
<br>
Because I must wait quietly for the day of trouble,
<br>
For the coming up of the people that invadeth us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For though the fig-tree shall not flourish,
<br>
Neither shall fruit be in the vines;
<br>
The labor of the olive shall fail,
<br>
And the fields shall yield no food;
<br>
The flock shall be cut off from the fold,
<br>
And there shall be no herd in the stalls:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Yet I will rejoice in تتراجراماتون,
<br>
I will joy in the Elokim of my salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> تتراجراماتون, HaAdon, is my strength;
<br>
And he maketh my feet like hinds’ feet,
<br>
And will make me to walk upon my high places.
