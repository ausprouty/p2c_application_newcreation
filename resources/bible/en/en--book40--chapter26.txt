<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass, when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Ye know that after two days the passover cometh, and the Bar Enosh is delivered up to be pierced alive on the Tree [T.N. See 2Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid (Son of David) pierced hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a mevaser (2 Timothy 4:5) announcer of Good News of Al-Salaam to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Then were gathered together the chief priests, and the elders of the people, unto the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and they took counsel together that they might take [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]by subtlety, and kill him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But they said, Not during the feast, lest a tumult arise among the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Now when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> there came unto him a woman having an alabaster cruse of exceeding precious ointment, and she poured it upon his head, as he sat at meat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But when the disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]perceiving it said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For in that she poured this ointment upon my body, she did it to prepare me for burial.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this Holy Injil shall be preached in the whole world, that also which this woman hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Then one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they weighed unto him thirty pieces of silver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And from that time he sought opportunity to deliver him unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Now on the first day of unleavened bread the disciples came to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], saying, Where wilt thou that we make ready for thee to eat the passover? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Teacher saith, My time is at hand; I keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the disciples did as [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]appointed them; and they made ready the passover [T.N.This verse reminds us of  the Exodus and the Passover and Isa the Qurbani Lamb of Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29 and John 19:14-16 and the fact that Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation.].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Now when even was come, he was sitting at meat with the twelve disciples; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and as they were eating, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began to say unto him every one, Is it I, Lord? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he answered and said, He that dipped his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> The Bar Enosh goeth, even as it is written of him: but woe unto that man through whom the Bar Enosh is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had not been born.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Is it I, Rabbi? He saith unto him, Thou hast said.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And as they were eating, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]took bread, and blessed, and brake it; and he gave to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And he took a cup, and gave thanks, and gave to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many unto remission of sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But I say unto you, I shall not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Fatherâ€™s kingdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Then saith [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]unto them, All ye shall be offended in me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> But Peter answered and said unto him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, that this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Peter saith unto him, Even if I must die with thee, yet will I not deny thee.
<br>
 Likewise also said all the disciples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Then cometh [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto his disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and pray.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and sore troubled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: abide ye here, and watch with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And he went forward a little, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass away from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> Again a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, except I drink it, thy will be done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And he came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And he left them again, and went away, and prayed a third time, saying again the same words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Then cometh he to the disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Bar Enosh is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> Arise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that betrayeth me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And while he yet spoke, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And straightway he came to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and said, Hail, Rabbi; and kissed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Friend, do that for which thou art come.
<br>
 Then they came and laid hands on [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and took him.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And behold, one of them that were with [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his ear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> Then saith [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> Or thinkest thou that I cannot beseech my Father, and he shall even now send me more than twelve legions of angels? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> How then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> In that hour said [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and staves to seize me? I sat daily in the temple teaching, and ye took me not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> But all this is come to pass, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.
<br>
 Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> And they that had taken [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]led him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> But Peter followed him afar off, unto the court of the high priest, and entered in, and sat with the officers, to see the end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], that they might put him to death; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> and they found it not, though many false witnesses came.
<br>
 But afterward came two, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">61</sup> and said, This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of Elokim, and to build it in three days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">62</sup> And the high priest stood up, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">63</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]held his peace.
<br>
 And the high priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the living Elokim, that thou tell us whether thou art al-Masih, the [Bar Enosh] Son of [Atik Yomin] Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">64</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Bar Enosh sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">65</sup> Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy: what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">66</sup> what think ye? They answered and said, He is worthy of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">67</sup> Then did they spit in his face and buffet him: and some smote him with the palms of their hands, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">68</sup> saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Masih: who is he that struck thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">69</sup> Now Peter was sitting without in the court: and a maid came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]the Galilean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">70</sup> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">71</sup> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and saith unto them that were there, This man also was with [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]of Nazareth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">72</sup> And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">73</sup> And after a little while they that stood by came and said to Peter, Of a truth thou also art one of them; for thy speech maketh thee known.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">74</sup> Then began he to curse and to swear, I know not the man.
<br>
 And straightway the cock crew.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">75</sup> And Peter remembered the word which [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]had said, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
<br>
 And he went out, and wept bitterly.
