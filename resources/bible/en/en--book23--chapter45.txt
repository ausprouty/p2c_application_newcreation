<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him, and I will loose the loins of kings; to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I will go before thee, and make the rough places smooth; I will break in pieces the doors of brass, and cut in sunder the bars of iron; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that it is I, تتراجراماتون, who call thee by thy name, even the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For Ya’qub (Jacob) my servant’s sake, and Israel my chosen, I have called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I am تتراجراماتون, and there is none else; besides me there is no Elokim.
<br>
 I will gird thee, though thou hast not known me; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the west, that there is none besides me: I am تتراجراماتون, and there is none else.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I form the light, and create darkness; I make peace, and create evil; I am تتراجراماتون, that doeth all these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Distil, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, that it may bring forth salvation, and let it cause righteousness to spring up together; I, تتراجراماتون, have created it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath no hands? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Woe unto him that saith unto a father, What begettest thou? or to a woman, With what travailest thou?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things that are to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens; and all their host have I commanded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let my exiles go free, not for price nor reward, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall go after thee, in chains they shall come over; and they shall fall down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying, Surely Elokim is in thee; and there is none else, there is no Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Verily thou art a Elokim that hidest thyself, O Elokim of Israel, the Saviour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> They shall be put to shame, yea, confounded, all of them; they shall go into confusion together that are makers of idols.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But Israel shall be saved by تتراجراماتون with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be put to shame nor confounded world without end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون that created the heavens, the Elokim that formed the earth and made it, that established it and created it not a waste, that formed it to be inhabited: I am تتراجراماتون; and there is none else.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> I have not spoken in secret, in a place of the land of darkness; I said not unto the seed of Ya’qub (Jacob), Seek ye me in vain: I, تتراجراماتون, speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a Elokim that cannot save.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Declare ye, and bring it forth; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath showed this from ancient time? who hath declared it of old? have not I, تتراجراماتون? and there is no Elokim else besides me, a just Elokim and a Saviour; there is none besides me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am Elokim, and there is none else.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> By myself have I sworn, the word is gone forth from my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Only in تتراجراماتون, it is said of me, is righteousness and strength; even to him shall men come; and all they that were incensed against him shall be put to shame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> In تتراجراماتون shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.
