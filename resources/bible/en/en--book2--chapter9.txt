<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For if thou refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> behold, the hand of تتراجراماتون is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks: there shall be a very grievous murrain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And تتراجراماتون shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all that belongeth to the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And تتراجراماتون appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow تتراجراماتون shall do this thing in the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And تتراجراماتون did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead.
<br>
 But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa and unto Haron (Aaron), Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Musa sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Musa sprinkled it up toward heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the magicians could not stand before Musa because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And تتراجراماتون hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not unto them, as تتراجراماتون had spoken unto Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say unto him, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For I will this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people; that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou hadst been cut off from the earth: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> but in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> As yet exaltest thou thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field; for every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> He that feared the word of تتراجراماتون among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he that regarded not the word of تتراجراماتون left his servants and his cattle in the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Stretch forth thy hand toward heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Musa stretched forth his rod toward heaven: and تتراجراماتون sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down unto the earth; and تتراجراماتون rained hail upon the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And the hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both man and beast; and the hail smote every herb of the field, and brake every tree of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, was there no hail.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Pharaoh sent, and called for Musa and Haron (Aaron), and said unto them, I have sinned this time: تتراجراماتون is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Entreat تتراجراماتون; for there hath been enough of these mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Musa said unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands unto تتراجراماتون; the thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know that the earth is تتراجراماتون’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear تتراجراماتون Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was in bloom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten: for they were not grown up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And Musa went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands unto تتراجراماتون: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the children of Israel go, as تتراجراماتون had spoken by Musa.
