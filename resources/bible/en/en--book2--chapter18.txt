<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Musa’ father-in-law, heard of all that Elokim had done for Musa, and for Israel his people, how that تتراجراماتون had brought Israel out of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Jethro, Musa’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Musa’ wife, after he had sent her away, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and her two sons; of whom the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and the name of the other was Eliezer; for he said, The Elokim of my father was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Jethro, Musa’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Musa into the wilderness where he was encamped, at the mount of Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and he said unto Musa, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Musa went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Musa told his father-in-law all that تتراجراماتون had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how تتراجراماتون delivered them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which تتراجراماتون had done to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand of the Egyptians.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Jethro said, Blessed be تتراجراماتون, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh; who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now I know that تتراجراماتون is greater than all Elokim; yea, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly against them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Jethro, Musa’ father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for Elokim: and Haron (Aaron) came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Musa’ father-in-law before Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Musa sat to judge the people: and the people stood about Musa from the morning unto the evening.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And when Musa’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand about thee from morning unto even? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Musa said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to inquire of Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> when they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between a man and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of Elokim, and his laws.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Musa’ father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for the thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and Elokim be with thee: be thou for the people to Elokim-ward, and bring thou the causes unto Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and thou shalt teach them the statutes and the laws, and shalt show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear Elokim, men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> and let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge themselves: so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> If thou shalt do this thing, and Elokim command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people also shall go to their place in peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> So Musa hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And Musa chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought unto Musa, but every small matter they judged themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Musa let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land.
