<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth faith may enter in.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Trust ye in تتراجراماتون for ever; for in تتراجراماتون, even تتراجراماتون, is an everlasting rock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For he hath brought down them that dwell on high, the lofty city: he layeth it low, he layeth it low even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The foot shall tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The way of the just is uprightness: thou that art upright dost direct the path of the just.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O تتراجراماتون, have we waited for thee; to thy name, even to thy memorial name, is the desire of our soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee earnestly: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> تتراجراماتون, thy hand is lifted up, yet they see not: but they shall see thy zeal for the people, and be put to shame; yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> تتراجراماتون, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou hast also wrought all our works for us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> O تتراجراماتون our Elokim, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all remembrance of them to perish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thou hast increased the nation, O تتراجراماتون, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified; thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> تتراجراماتون, in trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so we have been before thee, O تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thy dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise.
<br>
 Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For, behold, تتراجراماتون cometh forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
