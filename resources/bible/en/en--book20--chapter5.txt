<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> My son, attend unto my wisdom;
<br>
Incline thine ear to my understanding:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> That thou mayest preserve discretion,
<br>
And that thy lips may keep knowledge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For the lips of a strange woman drop honey,
<br>
And her mouth is smoother than oil:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But in the end she is bitter as wormwood,
<br>
Sharp as a two-edged sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Her feet go down to death;
<br>
Her steps take hold on Sheol;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> So that she findeth not the level path of life:
<br>
Her ways are unstable, and she knoweth it not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me,
<br>
And depart not from the words of my mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Remove thy way far from her,
<br>
And come not nigh the door of her house;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Lest thou give thine honor unto others,
<br>
And thy years unto the cruel;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Lest strangers be filled with thy strength,
<br>
And thy labors be in the house of an alien,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And thou mourn at thy latter end,
<br>
When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And say, How have I hated instruction,
<br>
And my heart despised reproof;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers,
<br>
Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I was well-nigh in all evil
<br>
In the midst of the assembly and congregation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Drink waters out of thine own cistern,
<br>
And running waters out of thine own well.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Should thy springs be dispersed abroad,
<br>
And streams of water in the streets?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Let them be for thyself alone,
<br>
And not for strangers with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Let thy fountain be blessed;
<br>
And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> As a loving hind and a pleasant doe,
<br>
Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times;
<br>
And be thou ravished always with her love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
<br>
And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For the ways of man are before the eyes of تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And he maketh level all his paths.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> His own iniquities shall take the wicked,
<br>
And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> He shall die for lack of instruction;
<br>
And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
