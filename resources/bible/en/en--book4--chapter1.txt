<sup class="versenum">50</sup> but appoint thou the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, and over all the furniture thereof, and over all that belongeth to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up<sup class="versenum"> and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, according to their hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> But the Levites shall encamp round about the tabernacle of the testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> Thus did the children of Israel; according to all that تتراجراماتون commanded Musa, so did they.</sup>
