<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he continually multiplieth lies and desolation; and they make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> تتراجراماتون hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Ya’qub (Jacob) according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> In the womb he took his brother by the heel; and in his manhood he had power with Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him at Beth-el, and there he spoke with us, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> even تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of hosts; تتراجراماتون is his memorial name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Therefore turn thou to thy Elokim: keep kindness and justice, and wait for thy Elokim continually.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He is a trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Ephraim said, Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth: in all my labors they shall find in me no iniquity that were sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But I am تتراجراماتون thy Elokim from the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, as in the days of the solemn feast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I have also spoken unto the prophets, and I have multiplied visions; and by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Is Gilead iniquity? they are altogether false; in Gilgal they sacrifice bullocks; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) fled into the field of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And by a prophet تتراجراماتون brought Israel up out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Ephraim hath provoked to anger most bitterly: therefore shall his blood be left upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
