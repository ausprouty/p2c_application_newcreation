<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to draw up a narrative concerning those matters which have been fulfilled among us,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> even as they delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> it seemed good to me also, having traced the course of all things accurately from the first, to write unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus;<sup class="versenum">4</sup> that thou mightest know the certainty concerning the things wherein thou wast instructed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> There was in the days of Herod, king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and he had a wife of the daughters of Haron (Aaron), and her name was Elisabeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And they were both righteous before Elokim, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of HaAdon blameless.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they had no child, because that Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well stricken in years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Now it came to pass, while he executed the priest’s office before Elokim in the order of his course, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to enter into the temple of HaAdon and burn incense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And there appeared unto him an angel of HaAdon standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Zacharias was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias: because thy supplication is heard, and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For he shall be great in the sight of HaAdon, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ruach, even from his mother’s womb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And many of the children of Israel shall he turn unto HaAdon their Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of IIyas (Elijah), to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to walk in the wisdom of the just; to make ready for HaAdon a people prepared for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well stricken in years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the angel answering said unto him, I am Jibril (Gabriel), that stand in the presence of Elokim; and I was sent to speak unto thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall come to pass, because thou believedst not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and they marvelled while he tarried in the temple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And when he came out, he could not speak unto them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he continued making signs unto them, and remained dumb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And it came to pass, when the days of his ministration were fulfilled, he departed unto his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And after these days Elisabeth his wife conceived; and she hid herself five months, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Thus hath HaAdon done unto me in the days wherein he looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Now in the sixth month the angel Jibril (Gabriel) was sent from Elokim unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Yosef, of the house of David (Dawad); and the virgin’s name was Maryam.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And he came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favored, HaAdon is with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this might be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Maryam: for thou hast found favor with Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] [T.N. Zechariah 3:8 says Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee; for they are men that are a sign: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch (i.e. al-Masih; see Ezra 3:8; Zechariah 6:11-12, where the personal Name of the coming Masih is given here hundreds of years in advance through the Messianic Namesake Joshua/Yeshua/Isa the High Priest). This High Priest "sign man" (Zechariah 3:8) Yehoshua Ben Yehotzadak or Yeshua (Arabic: Isa) is the Kohen Gadol High Priest returning from the Golus Babel Babylonian Exile and this "Jesus" (see Targum Ha-Shivim Zechariah 6:11-12) points with his portentous Name to the Adon Kohen l'olam al divrati Melki-Tzedek (Psalm 110:1-4) and our Priest Masih who terminates the Golus of sinful estrangemeent from تتراجراماتون just as in<sup class="versenum">31 the Angel confirmed his saving Name ("Whoever calls on his Name will be saved, Romans 10:13; Acts 2:21; Joel 2:32). تتراجراماتون sent His Bar Enosh as the Psalm 110:4 Priest. Proverbs 8:22 says تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)]: and HaAdon Elokim shall give unto him the throne of his father David (Dawad): 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> and he shall reign over the house of Ya’qub (Jacob) for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And Maryam said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ruach shall come upon thee, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing which is begotten shall be called the Son of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And behold, Elisabeth thy kinswoman, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her that was called barren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> For no word from Elokim shall be void of power.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And Maryam said, Behold, the handmaid of HaAdon; be it unto me according to thy word.
<br>
 And the angel departed from her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And Maryam arose in these days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And it came to pass, when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Maryam, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Ruach; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> and she lifted up her voice with a loud cry, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come unto me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> For behold, when the voice of thy salutation came into mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And blessed is she that believed; for there shall be a fulfilment of the things which have been spoken to her from HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And Maryam said,
<br>
My soul doth magnify HaAdon,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And my spirit hath rejoiced in Elokim my Saviour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> For he hath looked upon the low estate of his handmaid:
<br>
For behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> For he that is mighty hath done to me great things;
<br>
And holy is his name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And his mercy is unto generations and generations
<br>
On them that fear him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> He hath showed strength with his arm;
<br>
He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> He hath put down princes from their thrones,
<br>
And hath exalted them of low degree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> The hungry he hath filled with good things;
<br>
And the rich he hath sent empty away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> He hath given help to Israel his servant,
<br>
That he might remember mercy
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> (As he spoke unto our fathers)
<br>
Toward Ibrahim (Abraham) and his seed for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> And Maryam abode with her about three months, and returned unto her house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> Now Elisabeth’s time was fulfilled that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> And her neighbors and her kinsfolk heard that HaAdon had magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> And it came to pass on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise the child; and they would have called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">61</sup> And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">62</sup> And they made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">63</sup> And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John.
<br>
 And they marvelled all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">64</sup> And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">65</sup> And fear came on all that dwelt round about them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">66</sup> And all that heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be? For the hand of HaAdon was with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">67</sup> And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ruach, and prophesied, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">68</sup> Blessed be HaAdon, the Elokim of Israel;
<br>
For he hath visited and wrought redemption for his people,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">69</sup> And hath raised up a horn of salvation for us
<br>
In the house of his servant David (Dawad)
<br>
<sup class="versenum">70</sup> (As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets that have been from of old),
<br>
<sup class="versenum">71</sup> Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">72</sup> To show mercy towards our fathers,
<br>
And to remember his holy covenant;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">73</sup> The oath which he sware unto Ibrahim (Abraham) our father,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">74</sup> To grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies
<br>
Should serve him without fear,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">75</sup> In holiness and righteousness before him all our days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">76</sup> Yea and thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Most High:
<br>
For thou shalt go before the face of HaAdon to make ready his ways;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">77</sup></sup> To give knowledge of salvation unto his people
<br>
In the remission of their sins,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">78</sup> Because of the tender mercy of our Elokim,
<br>
Whereby the dayspring from on high shall visit us,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">79</sup> To shine upon them that sit in darkness and the shadow of death;
<br>
To guide our feet into the way of peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">80</sup> And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto Israel.
