<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Whosoever believeth that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]is al-Masih is begotten of Elokim: and whosoever loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hereby we know that we love the children of Elokim, when we love Elokim and do his commandments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For this is the love of Elokim, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For whatsoever is begotten of Elokim overcometh the world: and this is the victory that hath overcome the world, even our faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]is the [Bar Enosh] Son of [Atik Yomin] Elokim? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> This is he that came by water and blood, even [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For there are three who bear witness, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood: and the three agree in one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> If we receive the witness of men, the witness of Elokim is greater: for the witness of Elokim is this, that he hath borne witness concerning his Son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He that believeth on the [Bar Enosh] Son of [Atik Yomin] Elokim hath the witness in him: he that believeth not Elokim hath made him a liar; because he hath not believed in the witness that [Atik Yomin] Elokim hath borne concerning his [Bar Enosh] Son [T.N. See Daniel 7:13-14. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the witness is this, that [Atik Yomin] Elokim gave unto us eternal life, and this life is in his [Bar Enosh] Son [T.N. See Daniel 7:13-14].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> He that hath the [Bar Enosh] Son hath the life; he that hath not the [Bar Enosh] Son of [Atik Yomin] Elokim hath not the life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> These things have I written unto you, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, even unto you that believe on the name of the [Bar Enosh] Son of [Atik Yomin] Elokim [T.N. See Daniel 7:13-14].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And this is the boldness which we have toward him, that, if we ask anything according to his will, he heareth us: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and if we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> If any man see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and Elokim will give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: not concerning this do I say that he should make request.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> We know that whosoever is begotten of Elokim sinneth not; but he that was begotten of Elokim keepeth himself, and the evil one toucheth him not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> We know that we are of Elokim, and the whole world lieth in the evil one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And we know that the [Bar Enosh] Son of [Atik Yomin] Elokim is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his [Bar Enosh] Son [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]. This is the true Elokim, and eternal life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> My little children, guard yourselves from idols.
