<sup class="versenum">1</sup> For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and were all baptized unto Musa in the cloud and in the sea; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and did all eat the same spiritual food; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Howbeit with most of them Elokim was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Neither let us make trial of HaAdon, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but Elokim is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of al-Masih? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of al-Masih? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to Elokim: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Ye cannot drink the cup of HaAdon, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of HaAdon, and of the table of demons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Or do we provoke HaAdon to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient.
<br>
 All things are lawful; but not all things edify.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbor’s good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> for the earth is HaAdon’s, and the fulness thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience’ sake: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the New Creation Masjid of Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.
