<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy, we faint not:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of Elokim deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And even if our Holy Injil is veiled, it is veiled in them that perish: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> in whom the Elokim of this world hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, that the light of the Holy Injil of the glory of Al-Masih, who is the image of Elokim, should not dawn upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For we preach not ourselves, but [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]as HaAdon, and ourselves as your servants for [Prophet] Isa’s [al-Masih pbuh]sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Seeing it is Elokim, that said, Light shall shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of Elokim in the face of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power may be of Elokim, and not from ourselves; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> we are pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> always bearing about in the body the dying of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], that the life also of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]may be manifested in our body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For we who live are always delivered unto death for [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]’ sake, that the life also of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So then death worketh in us, but life in you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, and therefore did I speak; we also believe, and therefore also we speak; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> knowing that he that raised up HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]shall raise up us also with [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and shall present us with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For all things are for your sakes, that the grace, being multiplied through the many, may cause the thanksgiving to abound unto the glory of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Wherefore we faint not; but though our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is renewed day by day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For our light affliction, which is for the moment, worketh for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal.
