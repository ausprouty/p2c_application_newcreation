<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Sanctify unto me all the first-born, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Musa said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand تتراجراماتون brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> This day ye go forth in the month Abib.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And it shall be, when تتراجراماتون shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep this service in this month.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee, in all thy borders.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, It is because of that which تتراجراماتون did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of تتراجراماتون may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath تتراجراماتون brought thee out of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And it shall be, when تتراجراماتون shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanite, as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it thee, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> that thou shalt set apart unto تتراجراماتون all that openeth the womb, and every firstling which thou hast that cometh of a beast; the males shall be تتراجراماتون’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck: and all the first-born of man among thy sons shalt thou redeem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And it shall be, when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say unto him, By strength of hand تتراجراماتون brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that تتراجراماتون slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beast: therefore I sacrifice to تتراجراماتون all that openeth the womb, being males; but all the first-born of my sons I redeem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And it shall be for a sign upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thine eyes: for by strength of hand تتراجراماتون brought us forth out of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that Elokim led them not by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for Elokim said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> but Elokim led the people about, by the way of the wilderness by the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Musa took the bones of Yusuf (Joseph) with him: for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel, saying, Elokim will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And تتراجراماتون went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light, that they might go by day and by night: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night, departed not from before the people.
