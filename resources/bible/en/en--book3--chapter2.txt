<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And when any one offereth an oblation of a meal-offering unto تتراجراماتون, his oblation shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and he shall bring it to Haron (Aaron)’s sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof.
<br>
 And the priest shall burn it as the memorial thereof upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto تتراجراماتون: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Haron (Aaron)’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of تتراجراماتون made by fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And when thou offerest an oblation of a meal-offering baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the baking-pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meal-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And if thy oblation be a meal-offering of the frying-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto تتراجراماتون: and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the priest shall take up from the meal-offering the memorial thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Haron (Aaron)’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of تتراجراماتون made by fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> No meal-offering, which ye shall offer unto تتراجراماتون, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> As an oblation of first-fruits ye shall offer them unto تتراجراماتون: but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And every oblation of thy meal-offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy Elokim to be lacking from thy meal-offering: with all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And if thou offer a meal-offering of first-fruits unto تتراجراماتون, thou shalt offer for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meal-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the bruised grain thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون.
