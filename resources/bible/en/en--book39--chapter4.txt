<sup class="versenum">1</sup> For, behold, the day cometh, it burneth as a furnace; and all the proud, and all that work wickedness, shall be stubble; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in its wings; and ye shall go forth, and gambol as calves of the stall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Remember ye the law of Musa my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel, even statutes and ordinances.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Behold, I will send you IIyas (Elijah) the prophet before the great and terrible day of تتراجراماتون come.

<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers; lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.
