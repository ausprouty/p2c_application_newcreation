<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Song of Ascents) They that trust in تتراجراماتون
<br>
Are as mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abideth for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> As the mountains are round about Jerusalem,
<br>
So تتراجراماتون is round about his people
<br>
From this time forth and for evermore.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For the sceptre of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous;
<br>
That the righteous put not forth their hands unto iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Do good, O تتراجراماتون, unto those that are good,
<br>
And to them that are upright in their hearts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways,
<br>
تتراجراماتون will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity.
<br>
Peace be upon Israel.
