<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Hear ye now what تتراجراماتون saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hear, O ye mountains, تتراجراماتون’s controversy, and ye enduring foundations of the earth; for تتراجراماتون hath a controversy with his people, and he will contend with Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Musa, Haron (Aaron), and Miriam.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; remember from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Wherewith shall I come before تتراجراماتون, and bow myself before the high Elokim? shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves a year old? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> will تتراجراماتون be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my first-born for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth تتراجراماتون require of thee, but to do justly, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with thy Elokim?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The voice of تتراجراماتون crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom will see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and a scant measure that is abominable? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Shall I be pure with wicked balances, and with a bag of deceitful weights? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Therefore I also have smitten thee with a grievous wound; I have made thee desolate because of thy sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt put away, but shalt not save; and that which thou savest will I give up to the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; and the vintage, but shalt not drink the wine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I may make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
