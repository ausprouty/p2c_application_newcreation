<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> A false balance is an abomination to تتراجراماتون;
<br>
But a just weight is his delight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> When pride cometh, then cometh shame;
<br>
But with the lowly is wisdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The integrity of the upright shall guide them;
<br>
But the perverseness of the treacherous shall destroy them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Riches profit not in the day of wrath;
<br>
But righteousness delivereth from death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way;
<br>
But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them;
<br>
But the treacherous shall be taken in their own iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish;
<br>
And the hope of iniquity perisheth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The righteous is delivered out of trouble;
<br>
And the wicked cometh in his stead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> With his mouth the Godless man destroyeth his neighbor;
<br>
But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth;
<br>
And when the wicked perish, there is shouting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted;
<br>
But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> He that despiseth his neighbor is void of wisdom;
<br>
But a man of understanding holdeth his peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He that goeth about as a tale-bearer revealeth secrets;
<br>
But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Where no wise guidance is, the people falleth;
<br>
But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it;
<br>
But he that hateth suretyship is secure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> A gracious woman obtaineth honor;
<br>
And violent men obtain riches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The merciful man doeth good to his own soul;
<br>
But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The wicked earneth deceitful wages;
<br>
But he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He that is stedfast in righteousness shall attain unto life;
<br>
And he that pursueth evil doeth it to his own death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to تتراجراماتون;
<br>
But such as are perfect in their way are his delight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Though hand join in hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished;
<br>
But the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> As a ring of gold in a swine’s snout,
<br>
So is a fair woman that is without discretion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The desire of the righteous is only good;
<br>
But the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> There is that scattereth, and increaseth yet more;
<br>
And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth only to want.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> The liberal soul shall be made fat;
<br>
And he that watereth shall be watered also himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> He that withholdeth grain, the people shall curse him;
<br>
But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favor;
<br>
But he that searcheth after evil, it shall come unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> He that trusteth in his riches shall fall;
<br>
But the righteous shall flourish as the green leaf.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind;
<br>
And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life;
<br>
And he that is wise winneth souls.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth;
<br>
How much more the wicked and the sinner!
