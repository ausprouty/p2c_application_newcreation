<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون visited Sarah as he had said, and تتراجراماتون did unto Sarah as he had spoken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Sarah conceived, and bare Ibrahim (Abraham) a son in his old age, at the set time of which Elokim had spoken to him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup></sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Ishaq (Isaac).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) circumcised his son Ishaq (Isaac) when he was eight days old, as Elokim had commanded him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) was a hundred years old, when his son Ishaq (Isaac) was born unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Sarah said, Elokim hath made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And she said, Who would have said unto Ibrahim (Abraham), that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the child grew, and was weaned: and Ibrahim (Abraham) made a great feast on the day that Ishaq (Isaac) was weaned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne unto Ibrahim (Abraham), mocking.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Wherefore she said unto Ibrahim (Abraham), Cast out this handmaid and her son: for the son of this handmaid shall not be heir with my son, even with Ishaq (Isaac).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the thing was very grievous in Ibrahim (Abraham)’s sight on account of his son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Elokim said unto Ibrahim (Abraham), Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy handmaid; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Ishaq (Isaac) shall thy seed be called.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And also of the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum"> 14</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and gave her the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child.
<br>
 And she sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Elokim heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of Elokim called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for Elokim hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make him a great nation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Elokim opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Elokim was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spoke unto Ibrahim (Abraham), saying, Elokim is with thee in all that thou doest: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> now therefore swear unto me here by Elokim that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) said, I will swear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to-day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Abimelech said unto Ibrahim (Abraham), What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of تتراجراماتون, the Everlasting Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.
