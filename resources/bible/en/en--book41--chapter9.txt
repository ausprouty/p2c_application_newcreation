<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There are some here of them that stand by, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of Elokim come with power.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And after six days [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]taketh with him Peter, and James, and John, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and his garments became glistering, exceeding white, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And there appeared unto them IIyas (Elijah) with Musa: and they were talking with [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Peter answereth and saith to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Musa, and one for IIyas (Elijah).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For he knew not what to answer; for they became sore afraid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And there came a cloud overshadowing them: and there came a voice out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)]: hear ye him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And suddenly looking round about, they saw no one any more, save [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]only with themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And as they were coming down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, save when the Bar Enosh should have risen again from the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And they kept the saying, questioning among themselves what the rising again from the dead should mean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And they asked him, saying, How is it that the scribes say that IIyas (Elijah) must first come? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he said unto them, IIyas (Elijah) indeed cometh first, and restoreth all things: and how is it written of the Bar Enosh, that he should suffer many things and be set at nought? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But I say unto you, that IIyas (Elijah) is come, and they have also done unto him whatsoever they would, even as it is written of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great multitude about them, and scribes questioning with them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And straightway all the multitude, when they saw him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he asked them, What question ye with them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And one of the multitude answered him, Teacher, I brought unto thee my son, who hath a dumb spirit; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and wheresoever it taketh him, it dasheth him down: and he foameth, and grindeth his teeth, and pineth away: and I spoke to thy disciples that they should cast it out; and they were not able.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he answereth them and saith, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I bear with you? bring him unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And they brought him unto him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him grievously; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he asked his father, How long time is it since this hath come unto him? And he said, From a child.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And oft-times it hath cast him both into the fire and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do anything, have compassion on us, and help us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, If thou canst! All things are possible to him that believeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saw that a multitude came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him, and enter no more into him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And having cried out, and torn him much, he came out: and the boy became as one dead; insomuch that the more part said, He is dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]took him by the hand, and raised him up; and he arose.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, How is it that we could not cast it out? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And he said unto them, This kind can come out by nothing, save by prayer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And they went forth from thence, and passed through Galilee; and he would not that any man should know it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Bar Enosh is delivered up into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he shall rise again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> But they understood not the saying, and were afraid to ask him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And they came to Capernaum: and when he was in the house he asked them, What were ye reasoning on the way? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> But they held their peace: for they had disputed one with another on the way, who was the greatest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And he sat down, and called the twelve; and he saith unto them, If any man would be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And he took a little child, and set him in the midst of them: and taking him in his arms, he said unto them, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Whosoever shall receive one of such little children in my name, receiveth me: and whosoever receiveth me, receiveth not me, but him that sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> John said unto him, Teacher, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followed not us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said, Forbid him not: for there is no man who shall do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> For he that is not against us is for us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink, because ye are Masihâ€™s, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And whosoever shall cause one of these little ones that believe on me to stumble, it were better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And if thy hand cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life maimed, rather than having thy two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And if thy foot cause thee to stumble, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life halt, rather than having thy two feet to be cast into hell
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And if thine eye cause thee to stumble, cast it out: it is good for thee to enter into the kingdom of Elokim with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> For every one shall be salted with fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> Salt is good: but if the salt have lost its saltness, wherewith will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace one with another.
