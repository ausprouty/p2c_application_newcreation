<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Thou shalt not take up a false report: put not thy hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause to turn aside after a multitude to wrest justice: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> neither shalt thou favor a poor man in his cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, thou shalt forbear to leave him, thou shalt surely release it with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thou shalt not wrest the justice due to thy poor in his cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Keep thee far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And thou shalt take no bribe: for a bribe blindeth them that have sight, and perverteth the words of the righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And a sojourner shalt thou not oppress: for ye know the heart of a sojourner, seeing ye were sojourners in the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and shalt gather in the increase thereof: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie fallow; that the poor of thy people may eat: and what they leave the beast of the field shall eat.
<br>
 In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thy oliveyard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may have rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the sojourner, may be refreshed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And in all things that I have said unto you take ye heed: and make no mention of the name of other Elokim, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep: seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it thou camest out from Egypt); and none shall appear before me empty [T.N.This verse reminds us of  the Exodus and the Passover and Isa the Qurbani Lamb of Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29 and John 19:14-16 and the fact that Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation.]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labors, which thou sowest in the field: and the feast of ingathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labors out of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before HaAdon تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring into the house of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim.
<br>
 Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Behold, I send an angel before thee, to keep thee by the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Take ye heed before him, and hearken unto his voice; provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgression: for my name is in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But if thou shalt indeed hearken unto his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies, and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For mine angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: and I will cut them off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Thou shalt not bow down to their Elokim, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them, and break in pieces their pillars.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And ye shall serve تتراجراماتون your Elokim, and he will bless thy bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> There shall none cast her young, nor be barren, in thy land: the number of thy days I will fulfil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> I will send my terror before thee, and will discomfit all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And I will send the hornet before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> I will not drive them out from before thee in one year, lest the land become desolate, and the beasts of the field multiply against thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou be increased, and inherit the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And I will set thy border from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the River: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand: and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their Elokim, it will surely be a snare unto thee.
