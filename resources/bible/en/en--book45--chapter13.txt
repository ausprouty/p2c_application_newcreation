<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Let every soul be in subjection to the higher powers: for there is no power but of Elokim; and the powers that be are ordained of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Therefore he that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of Elokim: and they that withstand shall receive to themselves judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil.
<br>
 And wouldest thou have no fear of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise from the same: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> for he is a minister of Elokim to thee for good.
<br>
 But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is a minister of Elokim, an avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Wherefore ye must needs be in subjection, not only because of the wrath, but also for conscience’ sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For for this cause ye pay tribute also; for they are ministers of Elokim’s service, attending continually upon this very thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Render to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Owe no man anything, save to love one another: for he that loveth his neighbor hath fulfilled the law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not covet, and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Love worketh no ill to his neighbor: love therefore is the fulfilment of the law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And this, knowing the season, that already it is time for you to awake out of sleep: for now is salvation nearer to us than when we first believed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The night is far spent, and the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Let us walk becomingly, as in the day; not in revelling and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But put ye on HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.
