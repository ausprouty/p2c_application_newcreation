<sup class="versenum">1</sup> He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For تتراجراماتون restoreth the excellency of Ya’qub (Jacob), as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress spears are brandished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away.
<br>
 Stand, stand, they cry; but none looketh back.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Behold, I am against thee, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
