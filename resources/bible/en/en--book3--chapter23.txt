<sup class="versenum">1</sup>And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The set feasts of تتراجراماتون, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work: it is a sabbath unto تتراجراماتون in all your dwellings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> These are the set feasts of تتراجراماتون, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at even, is تتراجراماتون’s passover [T.N.This verse reminds us of  the Exodus and the Passover and Isa the Qurbani Lamb of Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29 and John 19:14-16 and the fact that Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation.].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto تتراجراماتون: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون seven days: in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and he shall wave the sheaf before تتراجراماتون, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt-offering unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون for a sweet savor; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched grain, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the oblation of your Elokim: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave-offering; seven sabbaths shall there be complete: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal-offering unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah: they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baken with leaven, for first-fruits unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be a burnt-offering unto تتراجراماتون, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before تتراجراماتون, with the two lambs: they shall be holy to تتراجراماتون for the priest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the sojourner: I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Ye shall do no servile work; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day; he shall be cut off from his people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Ye shall do no manner of work: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> On the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون: on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون: it is a solemn assembly; ye shall do no servile work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> These are the set feasts of تتراجراماتون, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> besides the sabbaths of تتراجراماتون, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of تتراجراماتون seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before تتراجراماتون your Elokim seven days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And ye shall keep it a feast unto تتراجراماتون seven days in the year: it is a statute for ever throughout your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And Musa declared unto the children of Israel the set feasts of تتراجراماتون.
