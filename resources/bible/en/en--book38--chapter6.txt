<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And again I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before HaAdon of all the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The chariot wherein are the black horses goeth forth toward the north country; and the white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the south country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the strong went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth.
<br>
 So they walked to and fro through the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then cried he to me, and spoke unto me, saying, Behold, they that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah; and come thou the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are come from Babylon; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> yea, take of them silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh تتراجراماتون of hosts, saying, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch: and he shall grow up out of his place; and he shall build the temple of تتراجراماتون [T.N. See John 2:19 see Ezra 3:8 and Zechariah 3:8, where the personal Name of the coming Masih is given here hundreds of years in advance through the Messianic Namesake Joshua/Yeshua/Isa the High Priest. This High Priest "sign man" (Zechariah 3:8) Yehoshua Ben Yehotzadak or Yeshua (Arabic: Isa) is the Kohen Gadol High Priest returning from the Golus Babel Babylonian Exile and this "Jesus" (see Targum Ha-Shivim <sup class="versenum">11-12) points with his portentous Name to the Adon Kohen l'olam al divrati Melki-Tzedek (Psalm 110:1-4) and our Priest Masih who terminates the Golus of sinful estrangemeent from تتراجراماتون just as in Luke 1:31 the Angel confirmed his saving Name ("Whoever calls on his Name will be saved, Romans 10:13; Acts 2:21; Joel 2:32). تتراجراماتون sent His Bar Enosh as the Psalm 110:1:4 Kohen Adon. Proverbs 8:22 says تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41]; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> even he shall build the temple of تتراجراماتون [T.N. See John 2:19]; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of تتراجراماتون; and ye shall know that تتراجراماتون of hosts hath sent me unto you.
<br>
 And this shall come to pass, if ye will diligently obey the voice of تتراجراماتون your Elokim.
