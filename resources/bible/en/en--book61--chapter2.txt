<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> But there arose false prophets also among the people, as among you also there shall be false teachers, who shall privily bring in destructive heresies, denying even the Master that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And many shall follow their lascivious doings; by reason of whom the way of the truth shall be evil spoken of.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And in covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose sentence now from of old lingereth not, and their destruction slumbereth not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For if Elokim spared not angels when they sinned, but cast them down to hell, and committed them to pits of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah with seven others, a preacher of righteousness, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, having made them an example unto those that should live ungodly; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and delivered righteous Lot, sore distressed by the lascivious life of the wicked 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> (for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their lawless deeds): 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> HaAdon knoweth how to deliver the Godly out of temptation, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment unto the day of judgment; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of defilement, and despise dominion.
<br>
 Daring, self-willed, they tremble not to rail at dignities: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> whereas angels, though greater in might and power, bring not a railing judgment against them before HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But these, as creatures without reason, born mere animals to be taken and destroyed, railing in matters whereof they are ignorant, shall in their destroying surely be destroyed, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> suffering wrong as the hire of wrong-doing; men that count it pleasure to revel in the day-time, spots and blemishes, revelling in their deceivings while they feast with you; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; enticing unstedfast souls; having a heart exercised in covetousness; children of cursing; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> forsaking the right way, they went astray, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the hire of wrong-doing; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> but he was rebuked for his own transgression: a dumb ass spoke with the voice of a man and stayed the madness of the prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> These are springs without water, and mists driven by a storm; for whom the blackness of darkness hath been reserved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For, uttering great swelling words of vanity, they entice in the lusts of the flesh, by lasciviousness, those who are just escaping from them that live in error; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> promising them liberty, while they themselves are bondservants of corruption; for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he also brought into bondage.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of HaAdon and Saviour [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], they are again entangled therein and overcome, the last state is become worse with them than the first.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For it were better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after knowing it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> It has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog turning to his own vomit again, and the sow that had washed to wallowing in the mire.
