<sup class="versenum">1</sup> There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For the law of the Spirit of life in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]made me free from the law of sin and of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, Elokim, sending his own Son [T.N.Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> that the ordinance of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For they that are after the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For the mind of the flesh is death; but the mind of the Spirit is life and peace: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> because the mind of the flesh is enmity against Elokim; for it is not subject to the law of Elokim, neither indeed can it be: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and they that are in the flesh cannot please Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But ye are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of Elokim dwelleth in you.
<br>
 But if any man hath not the Spirit of al-Masih, he is none of his.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And if al-Masih is in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But if the Spirit of him that raised up [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]from the dead dwelleth in you, he that raised up [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]from the dead shall give life also to your mortal bodies through his Spirit that dwelleth in you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> for if ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For as many as are led by the Spirit of Elokim, these are sons of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For ye received not the spirit of bondage again unto fear; but ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The Spirit himself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are children of Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and if children, then heirs; heirs of Elokim, and joint-heirs with al-Masih; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed to us-ward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For the earnest expectation of the creation waiteth for the revealing of the sons of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For the creation was subjected to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him who subjected it, in hope 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> that the creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And not only so, but ourselves also, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for our adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> For in hope were we saved: but hope that is seen is not hope: for who hopeth for that which he seeth? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But if we hope for that which we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And in like manner the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity: for we know not how to pray as we ought; but the Spirit himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And we know that to them that love Elokim all things work together for good, even to them that are called according to his purpose.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For whom he foreknew, he also foreordained to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> and whom he foreordained, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> What then shall we say to these things? If Elokim is for us, who is against us? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him freely give us all things? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Who shall lay anything to the charge of Elokimâ€™s elect? It is Elokim that justifieth; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> who is he that condemneth? It is [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]that died, yea rather, that was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of Elokim, who also maketh intercession for us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Who shall separate us from the love of al-Masih? shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Even as it is written,
<br>
For thy sake we are killed all the day long;
<br>
We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of Elokim, which is in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] Adoneinu.
