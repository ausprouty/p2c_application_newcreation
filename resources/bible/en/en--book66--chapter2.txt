<sup class="versenum">1</sup> To the angel of the New Creation Masjid in Ephesus write:
<br>
These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, he that walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks:  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I know thy works, and thy toil and patience, and that thou canst not bear evil men, and didst try them that call themselves apostles, and they are not, and didst find them false;  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and thou hast patience and didst bear for my name’s sake, and hast not grown weary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I come to thee, and will move thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
 To him that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And to the angel of the New Creation Masjid in Smyrna write:
<br>
These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and lived again
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I know thy tribulation, and thy poverty (but thou art rich), and the blasphemy of them that say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Fear not the things which thou art about to suffer: behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days.
<br>
 Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
 He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And to the angel of the New Creation Masjid in Pergamum write:
<br>
These things saith he that hath the sharp two-edged sword:  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s throne is; and thou holdest fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwelleth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there some that hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So hast thou also some that hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Repent therefore; or else I come to thee quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
 To him that overcometh, to him will I give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth but he that receiveth it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And to the angel of the New Creation Masjid in Thyatira write:
<br>
These things saith the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like unto burnished brass:  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> I know thy works, and thy love and faith and ministry and patience, and that thy last works are more than the first.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But I have this against thee, that thou sufferest the woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess; and she teacheth and seduceth my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And I gave her time that she should repent; and she willeth not to repent of her fornication.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Behold, I cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of her works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And I will kill her children with death; and all the New Creation Masjid shall know that I am he that searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But to you I say, to the rest that are in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, who know not the deep things of Satan, as they are wont to say; I cast upon you none other burden.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Nevertheless that which ye have, hold fast till I come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And he that overcometh, and he that keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give authority over the nations:  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, as the vessels of the potter are broken to shivers; as I also have received of my Father:  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> and I will give him the morning star.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the New Creation Masjid.
