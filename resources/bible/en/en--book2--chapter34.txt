<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first: and I will write upon the tables the words that were on the first tables, which thou brakest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning unto mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And no man shall come up with thee; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first; and Musa rose up early in the morning, and went up unto mount Sinai, as تتراجراماتون had commanded him, and took in his hand two tables of stone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And تتراجراماتون descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And تتراجراماتون passed by before him, and proclaimed, تتراجراماتون, تتراجراماتون, a Elokim merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> keeping lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; and that will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children’s children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Musa made haste, and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshipped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he said, If now I have found favor in thy sight, O Lord, let HaAdon, I pray thee, go in the midst of us; for it is a stiffnecked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thine inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do marvels, such as have not been wrought in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of تتراجراماتون; for it is a terrible thing that I do with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Observe thou that which I command thee this day: behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> but ye shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their Asherim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> for thou shalt worship no other Elokim: for تتراجراماتون, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they play the harlot after their Elokim, and sacrifice unto their Elokim, and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters play the harlot after their Elokim, and make thy sons play the harlot after their Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Thou shalt make thee no molten Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep.
<br>
 Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou camest out from Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> All that openeth the womb is mine; and all thy cattle that is male, the firstlings of cow and sheep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break its neck.
<br>
 All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem.
<br>
 And none shall appear before me empty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in plowing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, even of the first-fruits of wheat harvest, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before HaAdon تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> For I will cast out nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou goest up to appear before تتراجراماتون thy Elokim three times in the year.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> The first of the first-fruits of thy ground thou shalt bring unto the house of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim.
<br>
 Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And he was there with تتراجراماتون forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink water.
<br>
 And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And it came to pass, when Musa came down from mount Sinai with the two tables of the testimony in Musa’ hand, when he came down from the mount, that Musa knew not that the skin of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And when Haron (Aaron) and all the children of Israel saw Musa, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come nigh him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And Musa called unto them; and Haron (Aaron) and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him: and Musa spoke to them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that تتراجراماتون had spoken with him in mount Sinai.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And when Musa had done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> But when Musa went in before تتراجراماتون to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and spoke unto the children of Israel that which he was commanded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And the children of Israel saw the face of Musa, that the skin of Musa’ face shone: and Musa put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him.
