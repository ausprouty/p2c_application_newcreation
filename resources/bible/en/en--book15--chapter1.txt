<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of تتراجراماتون by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, تتراجراماتون stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth hath تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of heaven, given me; and he hath charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Whosoever there is among you of all his people, his Elokim be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel (he is Elokim), which is in Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And whosoever is left, in any place where he sojourneth, let the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and with goods, and with beasts, besides the freewill-offering for the house of Elokim which is in Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then rose up the heads of fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit Elokim had stirred to go up to build the house of تتراجراماتون which is in Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And all they that were round about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with beasts, and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of تتراجراماتون, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, nine and twenty knives, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> thirty bowls of gold, silver bowls of a second sort four hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred.
<br>
 All these did Sheshbazzar bring up, when they of the captivity were brought up from Babylon unto Jerusalem.
