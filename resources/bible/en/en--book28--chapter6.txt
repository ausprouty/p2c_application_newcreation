<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Come, and let us return unto تتراجراماتون; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> After two days will he revive us: on the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And let us know, let us follow on to know تتراجراماتون: his going forth is sure as the morning; and he will come unto us as the rain, as the latter rain that watereth the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the dew that goeth early away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For I desire goodness, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of Elokim more than burnt-offerings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But they like Adam have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity; it is stained with blood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way toward Shechem; yea, they have committed lewdness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: there whoredom is found in Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Also, O Judah, there is a harvest appointed for thee, when I bring back the captivity of my people.
