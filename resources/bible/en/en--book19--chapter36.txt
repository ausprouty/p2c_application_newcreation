<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Dawad the servant of تتراجراماتون.) The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart,
<br>
There is no fear of Elokim before his eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For he flattereth himself in his own eyes,
<br>
That his iniquity will not be found out and be hated.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit:
<br>
He hath ceased to be wise and to do good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He deviseth iniquity upon his bed;
<br>
He setteth himself in a way that is not good;
<br>
He abhorreth not evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thy lovingkindness, O تتراجراماتون, is in the heavens;
<br>
Thy faithfulness reacheth unto the skies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thy righteousness is like the mountains of Elokim;
<br>
Thy judgments are a great deep:
<br>
O تتراجراماتون, thou preservest man and beast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> How precious is thy lovingkindness, O Elokim!
<br>
And the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;
<br>
And thou wilt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For with thee is the fountain of life:
<br>
In thy light shall we see light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Oh continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee,
<br>
And thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Let not the foot of pride come against me,
<br>
And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> There are the workers of iniquity fallen:
<br>
They are thrust down, and shall not be able to rise.
