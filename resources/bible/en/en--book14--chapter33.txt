<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he did that which was evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون, after the abominations of the nations whom تتراجراماتون cast out before the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father had broken down; and he reared up altars for the Baalim, and made Asheroth, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he built altars in the house of تتراجراماتون, whereof تتراجراماتون said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He also made his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of Hinnom; and he practised augury, and used enchantments, and practised sorcery, and dealt with them that had familiar spirits, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون, to provoke him to anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he set the graven image of the idol, which he had made, in the house of Elokim, of which Elokim said to David (Dawad) and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from off the land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will observe to do all that I have commanded them, even all the law and the statutes and the ordinances given by Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Manasseh seduced Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that they did evil more than did the nations whom تتراجراماتون destroyed before the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke to Manasseh, and to his people; but they gave no heed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Wherefore تتراجراماتون brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of Assyria, who took Manasseh in chains, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And when he was in distress, he besought تتراجراماتون his Elokim, and humbled himself greatly before the Elokim of his fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he prayed unto him; and he was entreated of him, and heard his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom.
<br>
 Then Manasseh knew that تتراجراماتون he was Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Now after this he built an outer wall to the city of David (Dawad), on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entrance at the fish gate; and he compassed Ophel about with it, and raised it up to a very great height: and he put valiant captains in all the fortified cities of Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he took away the foreign Elokim, and the idol out of the house of تتراجراماتون, and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of تتراجراماتون, and in Jerusalem, and cast them out of the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he built up the altar of تتراجراماتون, and offered thereon sacrifices of peace-offerings and of thanksgiving, and commanded Judah to serve تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Nevertheless the people sacrificed still in the high places, but only unto تتراجراماتون their Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his Elokim, and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, behold, they are written among the acts of the kings of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> His prayer also, and how Elokim was entreated of him, and all his sin and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high places, and set up the Asherim and the graven images, before he humbled himself, behold, they are written in the history of Hozai.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign; and he reigned two years in Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And he did that which was evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون, as did Manasseh his father; and Amon sacrificed unto all the graven images which Manasseh his father had made, and served them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he humbled not himself before تتراجراماتون, as Manasseh his father had humbled himself; but this same Amon trespassed more and more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And his servants conspired against him, and put him to death in his own house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.
