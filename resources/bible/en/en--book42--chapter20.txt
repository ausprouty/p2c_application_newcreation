<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass, on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the Holy Injil, there came upon him the chief priests and the scribes with the elders;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and they spoke, saying unto him, Tell us: By what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he answered and said unto them, I also will ask you a question; and tell me: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why did ye not believe him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But if we shall say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he began to speak unto the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country for a long time.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he sent yet another servant: and him also they beat, and handled him shamefully, and sent him away empty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he sent yet a third: and him also they wounded, and cast him forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the lord of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned one with another, saying, This is the heir; let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And they cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.
<br>
 What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do unto them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> He will come and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.
<br>
 And when they heard it, they said, Elokim forbid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But he looked upon them, and said, What then is this that is written,
<br>
The stone which the builders rejected,
<br>
The same was made the head of the corner?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Every one that falleth on that stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he spoke this parable against them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who feigned themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his speech, so as to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they asked him, saying, Teacher, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, and acceptest not the person of any, but of a truth teachest the way of Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar, or not? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Show me a denarius.
<br>
 Whose image and superscription hath it? And they said, Caesar’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And he said unto them, Then render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and unto Elokim the things that are Elokim’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And they were not able to take hold of the saying before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And there came to him certain of the Sadducees, they that say that there is no resurrection; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> and they asked him, saying, Teacher, Musa wrote unto us, that if a man’s brother die, having a wife, and he be childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died childless; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> and the second: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> and the third took her; and likewise the seven also left no children, and died.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Afterward the woman also died.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> In the resurrection therefore whose wife of them shall she be? for the seven had her to wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, The sons of this world marry, and are given in marriage<sup class="versenum"> 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> but they that are accounted worthy to attain to that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:<sup class="versenum">36</sup> for neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are sons of Elokim, being sons of the resurrection.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> But that the dead are raised, even Musa showed, in the place concerning the Bush, when he calleth HaAdon the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), and the Elokim of Ishaq (Isaac), and the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Now he is not the Elokim of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And certain of the scribes answering said, Teacher, thou hast well said.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> For they durst not any more ask him any question.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And he said unto them, How say they that al-Masih is David’s son? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> For David (Dawad) himself saith in the book of Psalms,
<br>
HaAdon said unto Adoni,
<br>
Sit thou on my right hand,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> David (Dawad) therefore calleth him Lord, and how is he his son?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And in the hearing of all the people he said unto his disciples, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplaces, and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater condemnation.
