<sup class="versenum">1</sup> If one be found slain in the land which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them تتراجراماتون thy Elokim hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of تتراجراماتون; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Forgive, O تتراجراماتون, thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of thy people Israel.
<br>
 And the blood shall be forgiven them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and تتراجراماتون thy Elokim delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and, though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And all the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones: so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is accursed of Elokim; that thou defile not thy land which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim giveth thee for an inheritance.
