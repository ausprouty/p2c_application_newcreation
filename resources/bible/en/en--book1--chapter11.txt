<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup></sup> And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly.
<br>
 And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And تتراجراماتون came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And تتراجراماتون said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> So تتراجراماتون scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because تتراجراماتون did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did تتراجراماتون scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> These are the generations of Shem.
<br>
 Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood:<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah:<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Hud (Eber): 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and Shelah lived after he begat Hud (Eber) four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And Hud (Eber) lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and Hud (Eber) lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Now these are the generations of Terah.
<br>
 Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lut (Lot).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And Sarai was barren; She had no child.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And Terah took Abram his son, and Lut (Lot) the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
