<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of Ya’qub (Jacob) their sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways: as a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their Elokim, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near unto Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find your own pleasure, and exact all your labors.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Behold, ye fast for strife and contention, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye fast not this day so as to make your voice to be heard on high.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man to afflict his soul? Is it to bow down his head as a rush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast, and an acceptable day to تتراجراماتون? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Is not this the fast that I have chosen: to loose the bonds of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy healing shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of تتراجراماتون shall be thy rearward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then shalt thou call, and تتراجراماتون will answer; thou shalt cry, and he will say, Here I am.
<br>
If thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and speaking wickedly; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in darkness, and thine obscurity be as the noonday; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and تتراجراماتون will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in dry places, and make strong thy bones; and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places; thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, and the holy of تتراجراماتون honorable; and shalt honor it, not doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking thine own words: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> then shalt thou delight thyself in تتراجراماتون; and I will make thee to ride upon the high places of the earth; and I will feed thee with the heritage of Ya’qub (Jacob) thy father: for the mouth of تتراجراماتون hath spoken it.
