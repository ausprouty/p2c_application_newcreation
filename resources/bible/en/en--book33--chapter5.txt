<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now shalt thou gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us; they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But thou, Beth-lehem Ephrathah, which art little to be among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall one come forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting [T.N. Isaiah 9:6 says al-Masih is possessor of eternity, Avi Ad (Father of Eternity, Father in the sense of possessor of Eternity, see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word); notice here "olam" can be used of “absolute eternity” (cf. Psalms 10:16; 90:1-2, etc; see Habakkuk 1:12 on "mikedem"); also notice the Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, the saving eternal Word, the saving eternal Masih, John 1:1-14, who came to Maryam as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41; Daniel 7:13-14; Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).].

<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she who travaileth hath brought forth: then the residue of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he shall stand, and shall feed his flock in the strength of تتراجراماتون, in the majesty of the name of تتراجراماتون his Elokim: and they shall abide; for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And this man shall be our peace.
<br>
 When the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our border.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the remnant of Ya’qub (Jacob) shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from تتراجراماتون, as showers upon the grass, that tarry not for man, nor wait for the sons of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the remnant of Ya’qub (Jacob) shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep; who, if he go through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and there is none to deliver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Let thy hand be lifted up above thine adversaries, and let all thine enemies be cut off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith تتراجراماتون, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and will destroy thy chariots: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and I will cut off the cities of thy land, and will throw down all thy strongholds.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy hand; and thou shalt have no more soothsayers: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and I will cut off thy graven images and thy pillars out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thy hands; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and I will pluck up thine Asherim out of the midst of thee; and I will destroy thy cities.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And I will execute vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations which hearkened not.
