<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Dawad; to bring to remembrance) Make haste, O Elokim, to deliver me;
<br>
Make haste to help me, O تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Let them be put to shame and confounded
<br>
That seek after my soul:
<br>
Let them be turned backward and brought to dishonor
<br>
That delight in my hurt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Let them be turned back by reason of their shame
<br>
That say, Aha, aha.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee;
<br>
And let such as love thy salvation say continually,
<br>
Let Elokim be magnified.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But I am poor and needy;
<br>
Make haste unto me, O Elokim:
<br>
Thou art my help and my deliverer;
<br>
O تتراجراماتون, make no tarrying.
