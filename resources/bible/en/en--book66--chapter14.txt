<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their harps: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> These are they that were not defiled with women; for they are virgins.
<br>
 These are they that follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.
<br>
 These were purchased from among men, to be the firstfruits unto Elokim and unto the Lamb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having eternal good tidings to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and he saith with a great voice, Fear Elokim, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, that hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of Elokim, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of Elokim, and the faith of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in HaAdon from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw one sitting like unto the Bar Enosh, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great winepress, of the wrath of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.
