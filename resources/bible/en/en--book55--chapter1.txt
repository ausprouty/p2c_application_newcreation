<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, an apostle of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]through the will of Elokim, according to the promise of the life which is in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh],
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from Elokim the [Atik Yomin] Father and [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] [Bar Enosh] Adoneinu. 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I thank Elokim, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of Elokim, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For Elokim gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the Holy Injil according to the power of Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]before times eternal, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Holy Injil, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> That good thing which was committed unto thee guard through the Holy Ruach which dwelleth in us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> HaAdon grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> (HaAdon grant unto him to find mercy of HaAdon in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
