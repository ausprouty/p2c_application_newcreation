<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of تتراجراماتون’s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of تتراجراماتون, and to the house of the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob); and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.
<br>
 For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of تتراجراماتون from Jerusalem; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and he will judge between many peoples, and will decide concerning strong nations afar off: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig-tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of تتراجراماتون of hosts hath spoken it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For all the peoples walk every one in the name of his Elokim; and we will walk in the name of تتراجراماتون our Elokim for ever and ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> In that day, saith تتراجراماتون, will I assemble that which is lame, and I will gather that which is driven away, and that which I have afflicted; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and I will make that which was lame a remnant, and that which was cast far off a strong nation: and تتراجراماتون will reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Be in pain, and labor to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon: there shalt thou be rescued; there will تتراجراماتون redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see our desire upon Zion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But they know not the thoughts of تتراجراماتون, neither understand they his counsel; for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshing-floor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thy horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass; and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and I will devote their gain unto تتراجراماتون, and their substance unto HaAdon of the whole earth.
