<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Elokim blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens; with all wherewith the ground teemeth, and all the fishes of the sea, into your hand are they delivered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup></sup> Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you; as the green herb have I given you all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And surely your blood, the blood of your lives, will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it: and at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man’s brother, will I require the life of man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of Elokim made he man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Elokim spoke unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and with every living creature that is with you, the birds, the cattle, and every beast of the earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And I will establish my covenant with you; neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Elokim said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it, that I may remember the everlasting covenant between Elokim and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Elokim said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> These three were the sons of Noah: and of these was the whole earth overspread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Noah began to be a husbandman, and planted a vineyard:<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father’s nakedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had done unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And he said, Cursed be Canaan; A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And he said, Blessed be تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Shem; And let Canaan be his servant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Elokim enlarge Japheth, And let him dwell in the tents of Shem;
<br>
And let Canaan be his servant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years: and he died.
