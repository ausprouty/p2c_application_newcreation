<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old; and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he did that which was right in the eyes of تتراجراماتون, according to all that David (Dawad) his father had done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened the doors of the house of تتراجراماتون, and repaired them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them together into the broad place on the east, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites; now sanctify yourselves, and sanctify the house of تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of your fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون our Elokim, and have forsaken him, and have turned away their faces from the habitation of تتراجراماتون, and turned their backs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt-offerings in the holy place unto the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Wherefore the wrath of تتراجراماتون was upon Judah and Jerusalem, and he hath delivered them to be tossed to and fro, to be an astonishment, and a hissing, as ye see with your eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, that his fierce anger may turn away from us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> My sons, be not now negligent; for تتراجراماتون hath chosen you to stand before him, to minister unto him, and that ye should be his ministers, and burn incense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel the son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites; and of the sons of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehallelel; and of the Gershonites, Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and of the sons of Elizaphan, Shimri and Jeuel; and of the sons of Asaph, Zechariah and Mattaniah; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and of the sons of Heman, Jehuel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun, Shemaiah and Uzziel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves, and went in, according to the commandment of the king by the words of تتراجراماتون, to cleanse the house of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the priests went in unto the inner part of the house of تتراجراماتون, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of تتراجراماتون into the court of the house of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
 And the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad to the brook Kidron.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of تتراجراماتون; and they sanctified the house of تتراجراماتون in eight days: and on the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Then they went in to Hezekiah the king within the palace, and said, We have cleansed all the house of تتراجراماتون, and the altar of burnt-offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the table of showbread, with all the vessels thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast away when he trespassed, have we prepared and sanctified; and, behold, they are before the altar of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Then Hezekiah the king arose early, and gathered the princes of the city, and went up to the house of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven he-goats, for a sin-offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for Judah.
<br>
 And he commanded the priests the sons of Haron (Aaron) to offer them on the altar of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: and they killed the rams, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the lambs, and sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And they brought near the he-goats for the sin-offering before the king and the assembly; and they laid their hands upon them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and the priests killed them, and they made a sin-offering with their blood upon the altar, to make atonement for all Israel; for the king commanded that the burnt-offering and the sin-offering should be made for all Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And he set the Levites in the house of تتراجراماتون with cymbals, with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David (Dawad), and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet; for the commandment was of تتراجراماتون by his prophets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And the Levites stood with the instruments of David (Dawad), and the priests with the trumpets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt-offering upon the altar.
<br>
 And when the burnt-offering began, the song of تتراجراماتون began also, and the trumpets, together with the instruments of David (Dawad) king of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And all the assembly worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpeters sounded; all this continued until the burnt-offering was finished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto تتراجراماتون with the words of David (Dawad), and of Asaph the seer.
<br>
 And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto تتراجراماتون; come near and bring sacrifices and thank-offerings into the house of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
 And the assembly brought in sacrifices and thank-offerings; and as many as were of a willing heart brought burnt-offerings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And the number of the burnt-offerings which the assembly brought was threescore and ten bullocks, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt-offering to تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all the burnt-offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them, till the work was ended, and until the priests had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
<br>
 35	 And also the burnt-offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace-offerings, and with the drink-offerings for every burnt-offering.
<br>
 So the service of the house of تتراجراماتون was set in order.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which Elokim had prepared for the people: for the thing was done suddenly.
