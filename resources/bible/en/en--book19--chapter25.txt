<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (A Psalm of Dawad) Unto thee, O تتراجراماتون, do I lift up my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> O my Elokim, in thee have I trusted,
<br>
Let me not be put to shame;
<br>
Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Yea, none that wait for thee shall be put to shame:
<br>
They shall be put to shame that deal treacherously without cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Show me thy ways, O تتراجراماتون;
<br>
Teach me thy paths.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Guide me in thy truth, and teach me;
<br>
For thou art the Elokim of my salvation;
<br>
For thee do I wait all the day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Remember, O تتراجراماتون, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindness;
<br>
For they have been ever of old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
<br>
According to thy lovingkindness remember thou me,
<br>
For thy goodness’ sake, O تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Good and upright is تتراجراماتون:
<br>
Therefore will he instruct sinners in the way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The meek will he guide in justice;
<br>
And the meek will he teach his way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> All the paths of تتراجراماتون are lovingkindness and truth
<br>
Unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For thy name’s sake, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Pardon mine iniquity, for it is great.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> What man is he that feareth تتراجراماتون?
<br>
Him shall he instruct in the way that he shall choose.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> His soul shall dwell at ease;
<br>
And his seed shall inherit the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The friendship of تتراجراماتون is with them that fear him;
<br>
And he will show them his covenant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Mine eyes are ever toward تتراجراماتون;
<br>
For he will pluck my feet out of the net.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me;
<br>
For I am desolate and afflicted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The troubles of my heart are enlarged:
<br>
Oh bring thou me out of my distresses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Consider mine affliction and my travail;
<br>
And forgive all my sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Consider mine enemies, for they are many;
<br>
And they hate me with cruel hatred.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Oh keep my soul, and deliver me:
<br>
Let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Let integrity and uprightness preserve me,
<br>
For I wait for thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Redeem Israel, O Elokim,
<br>
Out all of his troubles.
