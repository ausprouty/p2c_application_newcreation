<sup class="versenum">1</sup> But Saul, yet breathing threatening and slaughter against the disciples of HaAdon, went unto the high priest,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and asked of him letters to Damascus unto the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the Way, whether men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And as he journeyed, it came to pass that he drew nigh unto Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light out of heaven: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and he fell upon the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]whom thou persecutest: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> but rise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the men that journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but beholding no man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw nothing; and they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he was three days without sight, and did neither eat nor drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and HaAdon said unto him in a vision, Ananias.
<br>
 And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And HaAdon said unto him, Arise, and go to the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one named Saul, a man of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and he hath seen a man named Ananias coming in, and laying his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how much evil he did to thy saints at Jerusalem: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call upon thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But HaAdon said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> for I will show him how many things he must suffer for my nameâ€™s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Ananias departed, and entered into the house; and laying his hands on him said, Brother Saul, HaAdon, even [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], who appeared unto thee in the way which thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ruach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales, and he received his sight; and he arose and was baptized; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and he took food and was strengthened.
<br>
And he was certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And straightway in the synagogues he proclaimed [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], that he is the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he that in Jerusalem made havoc of them that called on this name? and he had come hither for this intent, that he might bring them bound before the chief priests.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> but their plot became known to Saul.
<br>
 And they watched the gates also day and night that they might kill him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> but his disciples took him by night, and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a basket.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And when he was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen HaAdon in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And he was with them going in and going out at Jerusalem, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> preaching boldly in the name of HaAdon: and he spoke and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they were seeking to kill him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And when the brethren knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> So the New Creation Masjid throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified; and, walking in the fear of HaAdon and in the comfort of the Holy Ruach, was multiplied.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And it came to pass, as Peter went throughout all parts, he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years; for he was palsied.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] healeth thee: arise, and make thy bed. And straightway he arose.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And all that dwelt at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned to HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And it came to pass in those days, that she fell sick, and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And as Lydda was nigh unto Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men unto him, entreating him, Delay not to come on unto us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And Peter arose and went with them.
<br>
 And when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise.
<br>
 And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And he gave her his hand, and raised her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And it became known throughout all Joppa: and many believed on HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And it came to pass, that he abode many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
