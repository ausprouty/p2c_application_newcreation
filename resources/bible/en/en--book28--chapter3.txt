<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress, even as تتراجراماتون loveth the children of Israel, though they turn unto other Elokim, and love cakes of raisins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be any man’s wife: so will I also be toward thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek تتراجراماتون their Elokim, and David (Dawad) their king, and shall come with fear unto تتراجراماتون and to his goodness in the latter days.
