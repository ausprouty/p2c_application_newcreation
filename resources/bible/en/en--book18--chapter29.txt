<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Ayyub (Job) again took up his parable, and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Oh that I were as in the months of old,
<br>
As in the days when Elokim watched over me;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> When his lamp shined upon my head,
<br>
And by his light I walked through darkness;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> As I was in the ripeness of my days,
<br>
When the friendship of Elokim was upon my tent;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> When the Almighty was yet with me,
<br>
And my children were about me;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> When my steps were washed with butter,
<br>
And the rock poured me out streams of oil!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> When I went forth to the gate unto the city,
<br>
When I prepared my seat in the street,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The young men saw me and hid themselves,
<br>
And the aged rose up and stood;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The princes refrained from talking,
<br>
And laid their hand on their mouth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The voice of the nobles was hushed,
<br>
And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me;
<br>
And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Because I delivered the poor that cried,
<br>
The fatherless also, that had none to help him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me;
<br>
And I caused the widowâ€™s heart to sing for joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I put on righteousness, and it clothed me:
<br>
My justice was as a robe and a diadem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> I was eyes to the blind,
<br>
And feet was I to the lame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I was a father to the needy:
<br>
And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous,
<br>
And plucked the prey out of his teeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Then I said, I shall die in my nest,
<br>
And I shall multiply my days as the sand:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> My root is spread out to the waters,
<br>
And the dew lieth all night upon my branch:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> My glory is fresh in me,
<br>
And my bow is renewed in my hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Unto me men gave ear, and waited,
<br>
And kept silence for my counsel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> After my words they spoke not again;
<br>
And my speech distilled upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And they waited for me as for the rain;
<br>
And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> I smiled on them, when they had no confidence;
<br>
And the light of my countenance they cast not down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> I chose out their way, and sat as chief,
<br>
And dwelt as a king in the army,
<br>
As one that comforteth the mourners.
