<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.
<br>
 And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now Ibrahim (Abraham) and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Ibrahim (Abraham), Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Is anything too hard for تتراجراماتون? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
<br>
 And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Ibrahim (Abraham) went with them to bring them on the way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And تتراجراماتون said, Shall I hide from Ibrahim (Abraham) that which I do; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> seeing that Ibrahim (Abraham) shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of تتراجراماتون, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that تتراجراماتون may bring upon Ibrahim (Abraham) that which he hath spoken of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And تتراجراماتون said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Ibrahim (Abraham) stood yet before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And تتراجراماتون said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto HaAdon, who am but dust and ashes: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And he spoke unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty’s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And he said, Oh let not HaAdon be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto HaAdon: peradventure there shall be twenty found there.
<br>
 And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And he said, Oh let not HaAdon be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And تتراجراماتون went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Ibrahim (Abraham): and Ibrahim (Abraham) returned unto his place.
