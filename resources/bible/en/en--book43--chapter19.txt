<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then Pilate therefore took [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and scourged him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold, the man! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Pierce alive on the Tree [see 2Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid pierced hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a mevaser to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5] him, pierce him alive on a Tree! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and pierce him alive on a Tree: for I find no crime in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], Whence art thou? But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]gave him no answer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to pierce thee alive on a Tree? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour.
<br>
 And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> They therefore cried out, Away with him, away with him, pierce alive on the Tree him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I pierce alive on a Tree your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be pierced alive on a Tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> They took [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore: and he went out, bearing the Tree for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> where they pierced alive on the Tree him, and with him two others, on either side one, and [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]in the midst.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the Tree.
<br>
 And there was written, [PROPHET] ISA [AL-MASIH PBUH]OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was pierced alive on the Tree was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, and in Latin, and in Greek.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The soldiers therefore, when they had pierced alive on the Tree [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith,
<br>
They parted my garments among them,
<br>
And upon my vesture did they cast lots.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> These things therefore the soldiers did.
<br>
 But there were standing by the Tree of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> When [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> After this [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> When [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the Tree upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high day), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was pierced alive on the Tree with him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> but when they came to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And after these things Yosef of Arimathea, being a disciple of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]: and Pilate gave him leave.
<br>
 He came therefore, and took away his body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> So they took the body of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Now in the place where he was pierced alive on the Tree there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
