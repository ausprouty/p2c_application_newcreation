<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Dawad).
<br>
 Blessed is he that considereth the poor:
<br>
تتراجراماتون will deliver him in the day of evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> تتراجراماتون will preserve him, and keep him alive,
<br>
And he shall be blessed upon the earth;
<br>
And deliver not thou him unto the will of his enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> تتراجراماتون will support him upon the couch of languishing:
<br>
Thou makest all his bed in his sickness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I said, O تتراجراماتون, have mercy upon me:
<br>
Heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Mine enemies speak evil against me, saying,
<br>
When will he die, and his name perish?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And if he come to see me, he speaketh falsehood;
<br>
His heart gathereth iniquity to itself:
<br>
When he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> All that hate me whisper together against me;
<br>
Against me do they devise my hurt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him;
<br>
And now that he lieth he shall rise up no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted,
<br>
Who did eat of my bread,
<br>
Hath lifted up his heel against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But thou, O تتراجراماتون, have mercy upon me, and raise me up,
<br>
That I may requite them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> By this I know that thou delightest in me,
<br>
Because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity,
<br>
And settest me before thy face for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Blessed be تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel,
<br>
From everlasting and to everlasting.
<br>
Amen, and Amen.
