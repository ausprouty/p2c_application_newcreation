<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back, close sealed with seven seals.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And no one in the heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look thereon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look thereon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not; behold, the Lion that is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David (Dawad), hath overcome to open the book and the seven seals thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of Elokim, sent forth into all the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he came, and he taketh it out of the right hand of him that sat on the throne.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the four and twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having each one a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And they sing a new song, saying,
<br>
Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and didst purchase unto Elokim with thy blood men of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and madest them to be unto our Elokim a kingdom and priests; and they reign upon the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> saying with a great voice,
<br>
Worthy is the Lamb that hath been slain to receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and might, and honor, and glory, and blessing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea, and all things that are in them, heard I saying,
<br>
Unto him that sitteth on the throne, and unto the Lamb, be the blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion, for ever and ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the four living creatures said, Amen.
<br>
 And the elders fell down and worshipped.
