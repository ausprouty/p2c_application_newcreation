<sup class="versenum">1</sup>And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Haron (Aaron), took each of them his censer, and put fire therein, and laid incense thereon, and offered strange fire before تتراجراماتون, which he had not commanded them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And there came forth fire from before تتراجراماتون, and devoured them, and they died before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Then Musa said unto Haron (Aaron), This is it that تتراجراماتون spoke, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified.
<br>
 And Haron (Aaron) held his peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Musa called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Haron (Aaron), and said unto them, Draw near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Musa had said.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Musa said unto Haron (Aaron), and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Let not the hair of your heads go loose, neither rend your clothes; that ye die not, and that he be not wroth with all the congregation: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which تتراجراماتون hath kindled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of تتراجراماتون is upon you.
<br>
 And they did according to the word of Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Haron (Aaron), saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Drink no wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tent of meeting, that ye die not: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and that ye may make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which تتراجراماتون hath spoken unto them by Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Musa spoke unto Haron (Aaron), and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal-offering that remaineth of the offerings of تتراجراماتون made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar; for it is most holy; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and ye shall eat it in a holy place, because it is thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, of the offerings of تتراجراماتون made by fire: for so I am commanded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the wave-breast and the heave-thigh shall ye eat in a clean place, thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for they are given as thy portion, and thy sons’ portion, out of the sacrifices of the peace-offerings of the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The heave-thigh and the wave-breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave-offering before تتراجراماتون: and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, as a portion for ever; as تتراجراماتون hath commanded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And Musa diligently sought the goat of the sin-offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Haron (Aaron) that were left, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin-offering in the place of the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before تتراجراماتون? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Behold, the blood of it was not brought into the sanctuary within: ye should certainly have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Haron (Aaron) spoke unto Musa, Behold, this day have they offered their sin-offering and their burnt-offering before تتراجراماتون; and there have befallen me such things as these: and if I had eaten the sin-offering to-day, would it have been well-pleasing in the sight of تتراجراماتون? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And when Musa heard that, it was well-pleasing in his sight.
