<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Then the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Then the herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O peoples, nations, and languages, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Therefore at that time, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and brought accusation against the Jews.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> They answered and said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, O king, live for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, shall be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> There are certain Jews whom thou hast appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve [T.N. The word "palach" here is an Aramaic word meaning to serve as deity. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego will not serve as deity Nebuchadnezzar's idols, but all peoples will serve as deity the Bar Enosh, according to Daniel 7:13-14.  This Bar Enosh is not an idol.  The Bar Enosh has authority to forgive and heal, Mark 2:10; see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9] not thy Elokim, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
<br>
 Then they brought these men before the king.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Nebuchadnezzar answered and said unto them, Is it of purpose, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, that ye serve not my Elokim, nor worship the golden image which I have set up? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, ye fall down and worship the image which I have made, well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that Elokim that shall deliver you out of my hands? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer thee in this matter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> If it be so, our Elokim whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace; and he will deliver us out of thy hand, O king.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy Elokim, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was wont to be heated.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he commanded certain mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Then these men were bound in their hosen, their tunics, and their mantles, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste: he spoke and said unto his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the aspect of the fourth is like a son of the Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)..
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace: he spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the Most High Elokim, come forth, and come hither.
<br>
 Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego came forth out of the midst of the fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And the satraps, the deputies, and the governors, and the king’s counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, that the fire had no power upon their bodies, nor was the hair of their head singed, neither were their hosen changed, nor had the smell of fire passed on them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the Elokim of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king’s word, and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any Elokim, except their own Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Therefore I make a decree, that every people, nation, and language, which speak anything amiss against the Elokim of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill; because there is no other Elokim that is able to deliver after this sort.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in the province of Babylon.
