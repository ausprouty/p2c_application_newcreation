<sup class="versenum">1</sup> For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a lamp that burneth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory, and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of تتراجراماتون shall name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of تتراجراماتون, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah; for تتراجراماتون delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee; and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy Elokim rejoice over thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that are تتراجراماتون’s remembrancers, take ye no rest, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> تتراجراماتون hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies; and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine, for which thou hast labored: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> but they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise تتراجراماتون; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up an ensign for the peoples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Behold, تتراجراماتون hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of تتراجراماتون: and thou shalt be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.
