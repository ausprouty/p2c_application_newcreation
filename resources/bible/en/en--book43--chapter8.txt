<sup class="versenum">1</sup> but [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]went unto the mount of Olives.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> they say unto him, Teacher, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Now in the law Musa commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And this they said, trying him, that they might have whereof to accuse him.
<br>
 But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, even unto the last: and [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And she said, No man, Lord.
<br>
 And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Again therefore [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]spoke unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> These words spoke he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> They perceived not that he spoke to them of the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Bar Enosh, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> As he spoke these things, many believed on him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore said to those Jews that had believed him, If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my disciples; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> They answered unto him, We are Ibrahim (Abraham)’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> If therefore the Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> I know that ye are Ibrahim (Abraham)’s seed, yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> I speak the things which I have seen with my Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from your father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> They answered and said unto him, Our father is Ibrahim (Abraham).
<br>
 [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, If ye were Ibrahim (Abraham)’s children, ye would do the works of Ibrahim (Abraham).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from Elokim: this did not Ibrahim (Abraham).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Ye do the works of your father.
<br>
 They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, If Elokim were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from Elokim; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Why do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do.
<br>
 He was a murderer from the beginning, and standeth not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
<br>
 When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> He that is of Elokim heareth the words of Elokim: for this cause ye hear them not, because ye are not of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon.
<br>
 Ibrahim (Abraham) died, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> Art thou greater than our father Ibrahim (Abraham), who died? and the prophets died: whom makest thou thyself? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> Your father Ibrahim (Abraham) rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Ibrahim (Abraham)? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Ibrahim (Abraham) was born, I am.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]hid himself, and went out of the temple.
