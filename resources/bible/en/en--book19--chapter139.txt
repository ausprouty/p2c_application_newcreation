<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Dawad) O تتراجراماتون, thou hast searched me, and known me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising;
<br>
Thou understandest my thought afar off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou searchest out my path and my lying down,
<br>
And art acquainted with all my ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For there is not a word in my tongue,
<br>
But, lo, O تتراجراماتون, thou knowest it altogether.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thou hast beset me behind and before,
<br>
And laid thy hand upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Such knowledge is too wonderful for me;
<br>
It is high, I cannot attain unto it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?
<br>
Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
<br>
If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> If I take the wings of the morning,
<br>
And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Even there shall thy hand lead me,
<br>
And thy right hand shall hold me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> If I say, Surely the darkness shall overwhelm me,
<br>
And the light about me shall be night;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Even the darkness hideth not from thee,
<br>
But the night shineth as the day:
<br>
The darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For thou didst possess [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] my inward parts: Thou didst cover me in my mother’s womb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I will give thanks unto thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
<br>
Wonderful are thy works;
<br>
And that my soul knoweth right well.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> My frame was not hidden from thee,
<br>
When I was made in secret,
<br>
And curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Thine eyes did see mine unformed substance;
<br>
And in thy book they were all written,
<br>
Even the days that were ordained for me,
<br>
When as yet there was none of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O Elokim!
<br>
How great is the sum of them!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
<br>
When I awake, I am still with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O Elokim:
<br>
Depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For they speak against thee wickedly,
<br>
And thine enemies take thy name in vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Do not I hate them, O تتراجراماتون, that hate thee?
<br>
And am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> I hate them with perfect hatred:
<br>
They are become mine enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Search me, O Elokim, and know my heart:
<br>
Try me, and know my thoughts;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And see if there be any wicked way in me,
<br>
And lead me in the way everlasting.
