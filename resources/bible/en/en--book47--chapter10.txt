<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now I Paul myself entreat you by the meekness and gentleness of Al-Masih, I who in your presence am lowly among you, but being absent am of good courage toward you:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> yea, I beseech you, that I may not when present show courage with the confidence wherewith I count to be bold against some, who count of us as if we walked according to the flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> (for the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but mighty before Elokim to the casting down of strongholds); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> casting down imaginations, and every high thing that is exalted against the knowledge of Elokim, and bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Al-Masih; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and being in readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be made full.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Ye look at the things that are before your face.
<br>
 If any man trusteth in himself that he is al-Masih’s, let him consider this again with himself, that, even as he is al-Masih’s, so also are we.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For though I should glory somewhat abundantly concerning our authority (which HaAdon gave for building you up, and not for casting you down), I shall not be put to shame: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> that I may not seem as if I would terrify you by my letters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For, His letters, they say, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Let such a one reckon this, that, what we are in word by letters when we are absent, such are we also in deed when we are present.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For we are not bold to number or compare ourselves with certain of them that commend themselves: but they themselves, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, are without understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But we will not glory beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the province which Elokim apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For we stretch not ourselves overmuch, as though we reached not unto you: for we came even as far as unto you in the Holy Injil of al-Masih: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> not glorying beyond our measure, that is, in other men’s labors; but having hope that, as your faith groweth, we shall be magnified in you according to our province unto further abundance, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> so as to preach the Holy Injil even unto the parts beyond you, and not to glory in another’s province in regard of things ready to our hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But he that glorieth, let him glory in HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom HaAdon commendeth.
