<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> My soul is weary of my life;
<br>
I will give free course to my complaint;
<br>
I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I will say unto Elokim, Do not condemn me;
<br>
Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress,
<br>
That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands,
<br>
And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Hast thou eyes of flesh?
<br>
Or seest thou as man seeth?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Are thy days as the days of man,
<br>
Or thy years as manâ€™s days,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> That thou inquirest after mine iniquity,
<br>
And searchest after my sin,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Although thou knowest that I am not wicked,
<br>
And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me
<br>
Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay;
<br>
And wilt thou bring me into dust again?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Hast thou not poured me out as milk,
<br>
And curdled me like cheese?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh,
<br>
And knit me together with bones and sinews.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness;
<br>
And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart;
<br>
I know that this is with thee:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> If I sin, then thou markest me,
<br>
And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> If I be wicked, woe unto me;
<br>
And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head;
<br>
Being filled with ignominy,
<br>
And looking upon mine affliction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion;
<br>
And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Thou renewest thy witnesses against me,
<br>
And increasest thine indignation upon me:
<br>
Changes and warfare are with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb?
<br>
I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> I should have been as though I had not been;
<br>
I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Are not my days few? cease then,
<br>
And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Before I go whence I shall not return,
<br>
Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The land dark as midnight,
<br>
The land of the shadow of death, without any order,
<br>
And where the light is as midnight.
