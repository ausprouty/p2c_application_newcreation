<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of Elokim came to present themselves before تتراجراماتون, that Satan came also among them to present himself before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered تتراجراماتون, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Ayyub (Job)? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth Elokim, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Satan answered تتراجراماتون, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> So Satan went forth from the presence of تتراجراماتون, and smote Ayyub (Job) with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce Elokim, and die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh.
<br>
 What? shall we receive good at the hand of Elokim, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Ayyub (Job) sin with his lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now when Ayyub’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spoke a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
