<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) called unto his sons, and said: Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the latter days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Assemble yourselves, and hear, ye sons of Ya’qub (Jacob);
<br>
And hearken unto Israel your father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Reuben, thou art my first-born, my might, and the beginning of my strength; The pre-eminence of dignity, and the pre-eminence of power.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Boiling over as water, thou shalt not have the pre-eminence; Because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed; Then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Simeon and Levi are brethren; Weapons of violence are their swords.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> O my soul, come not thou into their council; Unto their assembly, my glory, be not thou united; For in their anger they slew a man,
<br>
And in their self-will they hocked an ox.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; And their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Ya’qub (Jacob), And scatter them in Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Judah, thee shall thy brethren praise: Thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; Thy father’s sons shall bow down before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Judah is a lion’s whelp; From the prey, my son, thou art gone up: He stooped down, he couched as a lion, And as a lioness; who shall rouse him up?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet, Until Shiloh come; And unto him shall the obedience of the peoples be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Binding his foal unto the vine, And his ass’s colt unto the choice vine; He hath washed his garments in wine, And his vesture in the blood of grapes:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> His eyes shall be red with wine, And his teeth white with milk.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; And he shall be for a haven of ships; And his border shall be upon Sidon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he saw a resting-place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under taskwork.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the horse’s heels, So that his rider falleth backward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I have waited for thy salvation, O تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Gad, a troop shall press upon him; But he shall press upon their heel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, And he shall yield royal dainties.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Naphtali is a hind let loose: He giveth goodly words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Yusuf (Joseph) is a fruitful bough, A fruitful bough by a fountain; His branches run over the wall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The archers have sorely grieved him, And shot at him, and persecuted him:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Ya’qub (Jacob) (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Even by the Elokim of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> The blessings of thy father Have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors Unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: They shall be on the head of Yusuf (Joseph), And on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Benjamin is a wolf that raveneth: In the morning he shall devour the prey, And at even he shall divide the spoil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spoke unto them and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,<sup class="versenum">30</sup> in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Ibrahim (Abraham) bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burying-place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> There they buried Ibrahim (Abraham) and Sarah his wife; there they buried Ishaq (Isaac) and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah’ 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And when Ya’qub (Jacob) made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
