<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he entered into a boat, and crossed over, and came into his own city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Arise, and walk? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But that ye may know that the Bar Enosh hath authority on earth to forgive sins (then saith he to the sick of the palsy), Arise, and take up thy bed, and go unto thy house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he arose, and departed to his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But when the multitudes saw it, they were afraid, and glorified Elokim, who had given such authority unto men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And as [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]passed by from thence, he saw a man, called Matthew, sitting at the place of toll: and he saith unto him, Follow me.
<br>
 And he arose, and followed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in the house, behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]and his disciples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why eateth your Teacher with the publicans and sinners? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But when he heard it, he said, They that are whole have no need of a physician, but they that are sick.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But go ye and learn what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice: for I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then will they fast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And no man putteth a piece of undressed cloth upon an old garment; for that which should fill it up taketh from the garment, and a worse rent is made.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Neither do men put new wine into old wine-skins: else the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins perish: but they put new wine into fresh wine-skins, and both are preserved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> While he spoke these things unto them, behold, there came a ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And behold, a woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> for she said within herself, If I do but touch his garment, I shall be made whole.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]turning and seeing her said, Daughter, be of good cheer; thy faith hath made thee whole.
<br>
 And the woman was made whole from that hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]came into the rulerâ€™s house, and saw the flute-players, and the crowd making a tumult, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> he said, Give place: for the damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
<br>
 And they laughed him to scorn.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But when the crowd was put forth, he entered in, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And the fame hereof went forth into all that land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And as [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]passed by from thence, two blind men followed him, crying out, and saying, Have mercy on us, thou son of David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him: and [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They say unto him, Yea, Lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And their eyes were opened.
<br>
 And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]strictly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> But they went forth, and spread abroad his fame in all that land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And as they went forth, behold, there was brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke: and the multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> But the Pharisees said, By the prince of the demons casteth he out demons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]went about all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Holy Injil of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, because they were distressed and scattered, as sheep not having a shepherd.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest indeed is plenteous, but the laborers are few.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Pray ye therefore HaAdon of the harvest, that he send forth laborers into his harvest.
