<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Psalm of Dawad. Maschil) Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven,
<br>
Whose sin is covered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Blessed is the man unto whom تتراجراماتون imputeth not iniquity,
<br>
And in whose spirit there is no guile.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> When I kept silence, my bones wasted away
<br>
Through my groaning all the day long.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me:
<br>
My moisture was changed as with the drought of summer.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I acknowledged my sin unto thee,
<br>
And mine iniquity did I not hide:
<br>
I said, I will confess my transgressions unto تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For this let every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found:
<br>
Surely when the great waters overflow they shall not reach unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Thou art my hiding-place; thou wilt preserve me from trouble;
<br>
Thou wilt compass me about with songs of deliverance.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go:
<br>
I will counsel thee with mine eye upon thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding;
<br>
Whose trappings must be bit and bridle to hold them in,
<br>
Else they will not come near unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Many sorrows shall be to the wicked;
<br>
But he that trusteth in تتراجراماتون, lovingkindness shall compass him about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Be glad in تتراجراماتون, and rejoice, ye righteous;
<br>
And shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
