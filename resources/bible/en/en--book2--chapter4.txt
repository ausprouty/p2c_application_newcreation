<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Musa answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say, تتراجراماتون hath not appeared unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he said, Cast in on the ground.
<br>
 And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent; and Musa fled from before it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail: and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> That they may believe that تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of their fathers, the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), the Elokim of Ishaq (Isaac), and the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob), hath appeared unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And تتراجراماتون said furthermore unto him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom.
<br>
 And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again.
<br>
 (And he put his hand into his bosom again; and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
<br>
)<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Musa said unto تتراجراماتون, Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto him, Who hath made man’s mouth? Or who maketh a man dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, تتراجراماتون?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt speak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he said, Oh, Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the anger of تتراجراماتون was kindled against Musa, and he said, Is there not Haron (Aaron) thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him as Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And thou shalt take in thy hand this rod, wherewith thou shalt do the signs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Musa went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said unto him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren that are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Musa, Go in peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead that sought thy life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Musa took his wife and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Musa took the rod of Elokim in his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, When thou goest back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, Israel is my son, my first-born: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and I have said unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me; and thou hast refused to let him go: behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that تتراجراماتون met him, and sought to kill him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet; and she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood art thou to me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> So he let him alone.
<br>
 Then she said, A bridegroom of blood art thou, because of the circumcision.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And تتراجراماتون said to Haron (Aaron), Go into the wilderness to meet Musa. And he went, and met him in the mountain of Elokim, and kissed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Musa told Haron (Aaron) all the words of تتراجراماتون wherewith he had sent him, and all the signs wherewith he had charged him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) went and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> and Haron (Aaron) spoke all the words which تتراجراماتون had spoken unto Musa, and did the signs in the sight of the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And the people believed: and when they heard that تتراجراماتون had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.
