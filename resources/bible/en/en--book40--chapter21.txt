<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and came unto Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]sent two disciples,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> saying unto them, Go into the village that is over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And if any one say aught unto you, ye shall say, HaAdon hath need of them; and straightway he will send them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Now this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Tell ye the daughter of Zion,
<br>
Behold, thy King cometh unto thee,
<br>
Meek, and riding upon an ass,
<br>
And upon a colt the foal of an ass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the disciples went, and did even as [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]appointed them, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their garments; and he sat thereon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the most part of the multitude spread their garments in the way; and others cut branches from the trees, and spread them in the way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the multitudes that went before him, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David (Dawad): Blessed is he that cometh in the name of HaAdon; Hosanna in the highest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was stirred, saying, Who is this? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the multitudes said, This is the prophet, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], from Nazareth of Galilee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]entered into the temple of Elokim, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold the doves; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and he saith unto them, It is written, My house shall be called a house of prayer: but ye make it a den of robbers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children that were crying in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the son of David (Dawad); they were moved with indignation, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and said unto him, Hearest thou what these are saying? And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, Yea: did ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And he left them, and went forth out of the city to Bethany, and lodged there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Now in the morning as he returned to the city, he hungered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And seeing a fig tree by the way side, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only; and he saith unto it, Let there be no fruit from thee henceforward for ever.
<br>
 And immediately the fig tree withered away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How did the fig tree immediately wither away? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do what is done to the fig tree, but even if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou taken up and cast into the sea, it shall be done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one question, which if ye tell me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> The baptism of [T.N. See 2 Kings 5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that God can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (Romans 6:3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .] of John, whence was it? from heaven or from men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say unto us, Why then did ye not believe him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> But if we shall say, From men; we fear the multitude; for all hold John as a prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And they answered [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and said, We know not.
<br>
 He also said unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But what think ye? A man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to-day in the vineyard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And he answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented himself, and went.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And he came to the second, and said likewise.
<br>
 And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Which of the two did the will of his father? They say, The first.
<br>
 [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of Elokim before you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and ye, when ye saw it, did not even repent yourselves afterward, that ye might believe him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Hear another parable: There was a man that was a householder, who planted a vineyard, and set a hedge about it, and digged a winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into another country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And when the season of the fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, to receive his fruits.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did unto them in like manner.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> But afterward he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take his inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And they took him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard, and killed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> When therefore the lord of the vineyard shall come, what will he do unto those husbandmen? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will let out the vineyard unto other husbandmen, who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
<br>
The stone which the builders rejected,
<br>
The same was made the head of the corner;
<br>
This was from HaAdon,
<br>
And it is marvellous in our eyes?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of Elokim shall be taken away from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And he that falleth on this stone shall be broken to pieces: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will scatter him as dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And when they sought to lay hold on him, they feared the multitudes, because they took him for a prophet.
