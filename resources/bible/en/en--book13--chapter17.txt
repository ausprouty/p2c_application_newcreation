<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass, when David (Dawad) dwelt in his house, that David (Dawad) said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون dwelleth under curtains.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Nathan said unto David (Dawad), Do all that is in thy heart; for Elokim is with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And it came to pass the same night, that the word of Elokim came to Nathan, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Go and tell David (Dawad) my servant, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel, unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> In all places wherein I have walked with all Israel, spoke I a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David (Dawad), Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people Israel: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast gone, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
<br>
1 Chronicles 17<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will subdue all thine enemies.
<br>
 Moreover I tell thee that تتراجراماتون will build thee a house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled that thou must go to be with thy fathers, that I will set up thy seed after thee, who shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I will be his father, and he shall be my son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; <sup class="versenum">13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).]: and I will not take my lovingkindness away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee.]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> but I will settle him in my house and in my kingdom for ever; and his throne shall be established for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Then David (Dawad) the king went in, and sat before تتراجراماتون; and he said, Who am I, O تتراجراماتون Elokim, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And this was a small thing in thine eyes, O Elokim; but thou hast spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O تتراجراماتون Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> What can David (Dawad) say yet more unto thee concerning the honor which is done to thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> O تتراجراماتون, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> O تتراجراماتون, there is none like thee, neither is there any Elokim besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom Elokim went to redeem unto himself for a people, to make thee a name by great and terrible things, in driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou redeemest out of Egypt? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, تتراجراماتون, becamest their Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And now, O تتراجراماتون, let the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, be established for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And let thy name be established and magnified for ever, saying, تتراجراماتون of hosts is the Elokim of Israel, even a Elokim to Israel: and the house of David (Dawad) thy servant is established before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For thou, O my Elokim, hast revealed to thy servant that thou wilt build him a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And now, O تتراجراماتون, thou art Elokim, and hast promised this good thing unto thy servant: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> and now it hath pleased thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O تتراجراماتون, hast blessed, and it is blessed for ever.
