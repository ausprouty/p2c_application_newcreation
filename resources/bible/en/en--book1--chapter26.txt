<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And there was a famine in the land, besides the first famine that was in the days of Ibrahim (Abraham). And Ishaq (Isaac) went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And تتراجراماتون appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will establish the oath which I sware unto Ibrahim (Abraham) thy father; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these lands; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;<sup class="versenum">5</sup> because that Ibrahim (Abraham) obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Ishaq (Isaac) dwelt in Gerar: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: For he feared to say, My wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Ishaq (Isaac) was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Abimelech called Ishaq (Isaac), and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Ishaq (Isaac) said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might easily have lain with thy wife, and thou wouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Ishaq (Isaac) sowed in that land, and found in the same year a hundredfold: and تتراجراماتون blessed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the man waxed great, and grew more and more until he became very great: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and he had possessions of flocks, and possessions of herds, and a great household: and the Philistines envied him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Now all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the days of Ibrahim (Abraham) his father, the Philistines had stopped, and filled with earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And Abimelech said unto Ishaq (Isaac), Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Ishaq (Isaac) departed thence, and encamped in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Ishaq (Isaac) digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Ibrahim (Abraham) his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Ibrahim (Abraham): and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Ishaq’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the herdsmen of Gerar strove with Ishaq’s herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek, because they contended with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they digged another well, and they strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now تتراجراماتون hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And تتراجراماتون appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham) thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Ibrahim (Abraham)’s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of تتراجراماتون, and pitched his tent there: and there Ishaq’s servants digged a well.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend, and Phicol the captain of his host.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Ishaq (Isaac) said unto them, Wherefore are ye come unto me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And they said, We saw plainly that تتراجراماتون was with thee: and we said, Let there now be an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Ishaq (Isaac) sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And it came to pass the same day, that Ishaq’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And he called it Shibah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And when Esau was forty years old he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> and they were a grief of mind unto Ishaq (Isaac) and to Rebekah.
