<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> for all the first-born are mine; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast; mine they shall be: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Number the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.

<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Number all the first-born males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am تتراجراماتون) instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And Musa numbered, as تتراجراماتون commanded him, all the first-born among the children of Israel.

<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Take the Levites instead of all the first-born among the children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And for the redemption of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the first-born of the children of Israel, that are over and above the number of the Levites, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll; after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs): 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> and thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is redeemed, unto Haron (Aaron) and to his sons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And Musa took the redemption-money from them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> from the first-born of the children of Israel took he the money, a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> and Musa gave the redemption-money unto Haron (Aaron) and to his sons, according to the word of تتراجراماتون, as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.</sup>
