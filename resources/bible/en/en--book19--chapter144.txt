<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Psalm of Dawad) Blessed be تتراجراماتون my rock,
<br>
Who teacheth my hands to war,
<br>
And my fingers to fight:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> My lovingkindness, and my fortress,
<br>
My high tower, and my deliverer;
<br>
My shield, and he in whom I take refuge;
<br>
Who subdueth my people under me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> تتراجراماتون, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him?
<br>
Or the son of man, that thou makest account of him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Man is like to vanity:
<br>
His days are as a shadow that passeth away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Bow thy heavens, O تتراجراماتون, and come down:
<br>
Touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Cast forth lightning, and scatter them;
<br>
Send out thine arrows, and discomfit them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Stretch forth thy hand from above;
<br>
Rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters,
<br>
Out of the hand of aliens;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Whose mouth speaketh deceit,
<br>
And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I will sing a new song unto thee, O Elokim:
<br>
Upon a psaltery of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thou art he that giveth salvation unto kings;
<br>
Who rescueth David (Dawad) his servant from the hurtful sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hand of aliens,
<br>
Whose mouth speaketh deceit,
<br>
And whose right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> When our sons shall be as plants grown up in their youth,
<br>
And our daughters as corner-stones hewn after the fashion of a palace;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> When our garners are full, affording all manner of store,
<br>
And our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> When our oxen are well laden;
<br>
When there is no breaking in, and no going forth,
<br>
And no outcry in our streets:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Happy is the people that is in such a case;
<br>
Yea, happy is the people whose Elokim is تتراجراماتون.
