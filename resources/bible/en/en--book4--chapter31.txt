<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Musa spoke unto the people, saying, Arm ye men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute تتراجراماتون’s vengeance on Midian.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Musa sent them, a thousand of every tribe, to the war, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they warred against Midian, as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa; and they slew every male.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And they slew the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain: Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones; and all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods, they took for a prey.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And all their cities in the places wherein they dwelt, and all their encampments, they burnt with fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man and of beast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Musa, and unto Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan at Jericho.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Musa, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Musa was wroth with the officers of the host, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Musa said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against تتراجراماتون in the matter of Peor, and so the plague was among the congregation of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But all the women-children, that have not known man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And encamp ye without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, ye and your captives.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And as to every garment, and all that is made of skin, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood, ye shall purify yourselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle, This is the statute of the law which تتراجراماتون hath commanded Musa
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> howbeit the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> everything that may abide the fire, ye shall make to go through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with the water for impurity: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make to go through the water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterward ye shall come into the camp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the congregation; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> and divide the prey into two parts: between the men skilled in war, that went out to battle, and all the congregation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And levy a tribute unto تتراجراماتون of the men of war that went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the flocks: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for تتراجراماتون’s heave-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one drawn out of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, even of all the cattle, and give them unto the Levites, that keep the charge of the tabernacle of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And Musa and Eleazar the priest did as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> and threescore and twelve thousand oxen, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> and threescore and one thousand asses, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> and thirty and two thousand persons in all, of the women that had not known man by lying with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> and تتراجراماتون’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And the oxen were thirty and six thousand; of which تتراجراماتون’s tribute was threescore and twelve.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which تتراجراماتون’s tribute was threescore and one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And the persons were sixteen thousand; of whom تتراجراماتون’s tribute was thirty and two persons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And Musa gave the tribute, which was تتراجراماتون’s heave-offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And of the children of Israel’s half, which Musa divided off from the men that warred 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> (now the congregation’s half was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand, seven thousand and five hundred sheep, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> and thirty and six thousand oxen, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> and thirty thousand and five hundred asses, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> and sixteen thousand persons), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> even of the children of Israel’s half, Musa took one drawn out of every fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, that kept the charge of the tabernacle of تتراجراماتون; as تتراجراماتون commanded Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And the officers that were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds, came near unto Musa; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> and they said unto Musa, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war that are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And we have brought تتراجراماتون’s oblation, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, ankle-chains, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and armlets, to make atonement for our souls before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And Musa and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered up to تتراجراماتون, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> (For the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> And Musa and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, for a memorial for the children of Israel before تتراجراماتون.
