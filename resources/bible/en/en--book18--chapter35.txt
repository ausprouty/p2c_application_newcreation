<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Moreover Elihu answered and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thinkest thou this to be thy right,
<br>
Or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than Elokimâ€™s,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee?
<br>
And, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I will answer thee,
<br>
And thy companions with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Look unto the heavens, and see;
<br>
And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him?
<br>
And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> If thou be righteous, what givest thou him?
<br>
Or what receiveth he of thy hand?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art;
<br>
And thy righteousness may profit a son of man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;
<br>
They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But none saith, Where is Elokim my Maker,
<br>
Who giveth songs in the night,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth,
<br>
And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> There they cry, but none giveth answer,
<br>
Because of the pride of evil men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Surely Elokim will not hear an empty cry,
<br>
Neither will the Almighty regard it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not,
<br>
The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But now, because he hath not visited in his anger,
<br>
Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Therefore doth Ayyub (Job) open his mouth in vanity;
<br>
He multiplieth words without knowledge.
