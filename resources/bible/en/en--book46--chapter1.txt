<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, called to be an apostle of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] through the will of Elokim, and Sosthenes our brother,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> unto the New Creation Masjid of Elokim which is at Corinth, even them that are sanctified in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], called to be saints, with all that call upon the name of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] in every place, their Lord and ours: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Grace to you and peace from Elokim our Father and HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I thank my Elokim always concerning you, for the grace of Elokim which was given you in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> that in everything ye were enriched in him, in all utterance and all knowledge; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> even as the testimony of Al-Masih was confirmed in you: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> so that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the revelation of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye be unreproveable in the day of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Elokim is faithful, through whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] our Lord [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Now I beseech you, brethren, through the name of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For it hath been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them that are of the household of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Now this I mean, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Is Al-Masih divided? was Paul hanged on a Tree for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I thank Elokim that I baptized none of you, save Crispus and Gaius; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> lest any man should say that ye were baptized into my name [T.N. Romans 6:4 says we were buried with him through total immersion death ghusl burial into death: that like as al-Masih was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also might walk in newness of life. See 2 Kings 5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that God can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (Romans 6:3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .]
<br>
.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For Al-Masih sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Holy Injil: not in wisdom of words, lest the Tree of Al-Masih should be made void.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For the word of the Tree is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us who are saved it is the power of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For it is written,
<br>
I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
<br>
And the discernment of the discerning will I bring to nought.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not Elokim made foolish the wisdom of the world? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For seeing that in the wisdom of Elokim the world through its wisdom knew not Elokim, it was Elokim’s good pleasure through the foolishness of the preaching to save them that believe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Seeing that Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek after wisdom: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> but we preach Al-Masih pierced alive on the Tree [T.N. See 2Samuel 18:9-33 Ben Dovid pierced hanging alive on the Tree, the prophesied peace-bringing Holy Injil requiring a mevaser to herald it; see Psalm 22:16; Zechariah 12:10; Isaiah 53:5], unto Jews a stumblingblock, and unto Gentiles foolishness; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> but unto them that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Al-Masih the power of Elokim, and the wisdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Because the foolishness of Elokim is wiser than men; and the weakness of Elokim is stronger than men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For behold your calling, brethren, that not many wise after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> but Elokim chose the foolish things of the world, that he might put to shame them that are wise; and Elokim chose the weak things of the world, that he might put to shame the things that are strong; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> and the base things of the world, and the things that are despised, did Elokim choose, yea and the things that are not, that he might bring to nought the things that are: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> that no flesh should glory before Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> But of him are ye in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], who was made unto us wisdom from Elokim, and righteousness and sanctification, and redemption: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> that, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in HaAdon.
