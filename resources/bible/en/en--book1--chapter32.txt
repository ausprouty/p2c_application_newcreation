<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) went on his way, and the angels of Elokim met him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) said when he saw them, This is Elokim’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau: Thus saith thy servant Ya’qub (Jacob), I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and I have oxen, and asses, and flocks, and men-servants, and maid-servants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in thy sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the messengers returned to Ya’qub (Jacob), saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Then Ya’qub (Jacob) was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) said, O Elokim of my father Ibrahim (Abraham), and Elokim of my father Ishaq (Isaac), O تتراجراماتون, who saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I am not worthy of the least of all the lovingkindnesses, and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he lodged there that night, and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> then thou shalt say, They are thy servant Ya’qub’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Ya’qub (Jacob) is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that which he had.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Ya’qub’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh.
<br>
 And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Ya’qub (Jacob), but Israel: for thou hast striven with Elokim and with men, and hast prevailed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) called the name of the place Peniel: for, said he, I have seen Elokim face to face, and my life is preserved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he limped upon his thigh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Ya’qub’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.
