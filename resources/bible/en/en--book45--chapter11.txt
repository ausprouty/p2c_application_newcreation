<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I say then, Did Elokim cast off his people? Elokim forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Ibrahim (Abraham), of the tribe of Benjamin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Elokim did not cast off his people which he foreknew.
<br>
 Or know ye not what the scripture saith of IIyas (Elijah)? how he pleadeth with Elokim against Israel: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Lord, they have killed thy prophets, they have digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But what saith the answer of Elokim unto him? I have left for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But if it is by grace, it is no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> What then? That which Israel seeketh for, that he obtained not; but the election obtained it, and the rest were hardened: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> according as it is written, Elokim gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, unto this very day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And David (Dawad) saith,
<br>
Let their table be made a snare, and a trap,
<br>
And a stumblingblock, and a recompense unto them:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see,
<br>
And bow thou down their back always.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I say then, Did they stumble that they might fall? Elokim forbid: but by their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But I speak to you that are Gentiles.
<br>
 Inasmuch then as I am an apostle of Gentiles, I glorify my ministry; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> if by any means I may provoke to jealousy them that are my flesh, and may save some of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And if the firstfruit is holy, so is the lump: and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive, wast grafted in among them, and didst become partaker with them of the root of the fatness of the olive tree; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> glory not over the branches: but if thou gloriest, it is not thou that bearest the root, but the root thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thou wilt say then, Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Well; by their unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by thy faith.
<br>
 Be not highminded, but fear: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> for if Elokim spared not the natural branches, neither will he spare thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Behold then the goodness and severity of Elokim: toward them that fell, severity; but toward thee, Elokim’s goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And they also, if they continue not in their unbelief, shall be grafted in: for Elokim is able to graft them in again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> For if thou wast cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and wast grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree; how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant of this mystery, lest ye be wise in your own conceits, that a hardening in part hath befallen Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and so all Israel shall be saved: even as it is written,
<br>
There shall come out of Zion the Deliverer;
<br>
He shall turn away ungodliness from Ya’qub (Jacob):
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And this is my covenant unto them,
<br>
When I shall take away their sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> As touching the Holy Injil, they are enemies for your sake: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For the gifts and the calling of Elokim are not repented of.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> For as ye in time past were disobedient to Elokim, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> even so have these also now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they also may now obtain mercy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For Elokim hath shut up all unto disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of Elokim! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> For who hath known the mind of HaAdon? or who hath been his counsellor? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> For of him, and through him, and unto him, are all things.
<br>
 To him be the glory for ever.
<br>
 Amen.
