<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death.
<br>
 And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said unto him, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall, and prayed unto تتراجراماتون, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and said, Remember now, O تتراجراماتون, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight.
<br>
 And Hezekiah wept sore.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Then came the word of تتراجراماتون toIsaiah, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of David (Dawad) thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria; and I will defend this city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And this shall be the sign unto thee from تتراجراماتون, that تتراجراماتون will do this thing that he hath spoken: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> behold, I will cause the shadow on the steps, which is gone down on the dial of Ahaz with the sun, to return backward ten steps.
<br>
 So the sun returned ten steps on the dial whereon it was gone down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I said, In the noontide of my days I shall go into the gates of Sheol:
<br>
I am deprived of the residue of my years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I said, I shall not see تتراجراماتون, even تتراجراماتون in the land of the living:
<br>
I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> My dwelling is removed, and is carried away from me as a shepherd’s tent:
<br>
I have rolled up, like a weaver, my life; he will cut me off from the loom:
<br>
From day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I quieted myself until morning; as a lion, so he breaketh all my bones:
<br>
From day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Like a swallow or a crane, so did I chatter;
<br>
I did moan as a dove; mine eyes fail with looking upward:
<br>
O Lord, I am oppressed, be thou my surety.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it:
<br>
I shall go softly all my years because of the bitterness of my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> O Lord, by these things men live;
<br>
And wholly therein is the life of my spirit:
<br>
Wherefore recover thou me, and make me to live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Behold, it was for my peace that I had great bitterness:
<br>
But thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption;
<br>
For thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For Sheol cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee:
<br>
They that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day:
<br>
The father to the children shall make known thy truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> تتراجراماتون is ready to save me:
<br>
Therefore we will sing my songs with stringed instruments
<br>
All the days of our life in the house of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Now Isaiah had said, Let them take a cake of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he shall recover.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of تتراجراماتون?
