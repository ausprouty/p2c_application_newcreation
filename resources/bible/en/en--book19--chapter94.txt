<sup class="versenum">1</sup> O تتراجراماتون, thou Elokim to whom vengeance belongeth,
<br>
Thou Elokim to whom vengeance belongeth, shine forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth:
<br>
Render to the proud their desert.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> تتراجراماتون, how long shall the wicked,
<br>
How long shall the wicked triumph?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> They prate, they speak arrogantly:
<br>
All the workers of iniquity boast themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They break in pieces thy people, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And afflict thy heritage.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> They slay the widow and the sojourner,
<br>
And murder the fatherless.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they say, تتراجراماتون will not see,
<br>
Neither will the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob) consider.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Consider, ye brutish among the people;
<br>
And ye fools, when will ye be wise?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He that planted the ear, shall he not hear?
<br>
He that formed the eye, shall he not see?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He that chastiseth the nations, shall not he correct,
<br>
Even he that teacheth man knowledge?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> تتراجراماتون knoweth the thoughts of man,
<br>
That they are vanity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And teachest out of thy law;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
<br>
Until the pit be digged for the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For تتراجراماتون will not cast off his people,
<br>
Neither will he forsake his inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For judgment shall return unto righteousness;
<br>
And all the upright in heart shall follow it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Who will rise up for me against the evil-doers?
<br>
Who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Unless تتراجراماتون had been my help,
<br>
My soul had soon dwelt in silence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> When I said, My foot slippeth;
<br>
Thy lovingkindness, O تتراجراماتون, held me up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> In the multitude of my thoughts within me Thy comforts delight my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with thee,
<br>
Which frameth mischief by statute?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,
<br>
And condemn the innocent blood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But تتراجراماتون hath been my high tower,
<br>
And my Elokim the rock of my refuge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he hath brought upon them their own iniquity,
<br>
And will cut them off in their own wickedness;
<br>
تتراجراماتون our Elokim will cut them off.
