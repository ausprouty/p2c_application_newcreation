<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance; and he joined affinity with Ahab.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria.
<br>
 And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and moved him to go up with him to Ramoth-gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramoth-gilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for Elokim will deliver it into the hand of the king.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of تتراجراماتون besides, that we may inquire of him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of تتراجراماتون: but I hate him; for he never prophesieth good concerning me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla.
<br>
 And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, and they were sitting in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron and said, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, until they be consumed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper; for تتراجراماتون will deliver it into the hand of the king.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one mouth: let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Micaiah said, As تتراجراماتون liveth, what my Elokim saith, that will I speak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper; and they shall be delivered into your hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak unto me nothing but the truth in the name of تتراجراماتون? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and تتراجراماتون said, These have no master; let them return every man to his house in peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Micaiah said, Therefore hear ye the word of تتراجراماتون: I saw تتراجراماتون sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And تتراجراماتون said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one spoke saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And there came forth a spirit, and stood before تتراجراماتون, and said, I will entice him.
<br>
 And تتراجراماتون said unto him, Wherewith? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.
<br>
 And he said, Thou shalt entice him, and shalt prevail also: go forth, and do so.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Now therefore, behold, تتراجراماتون hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets; and تتراجراماتون hath spoken evil concerning thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of تتراجراماتون from me to speak unto thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back unto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king’s son; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, تتراجراماتون hath not spoken by me.
<br>
 And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle; but put thou on thy robes.
<br>
 So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went into the battle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, save only with the king of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore they turned about to fight against him: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and تتراجراماتون helped him; and Elokim moved them to depart from him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor: wherefore he said to the driver of the chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the host; for I am sore wounded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even; and about the time of the going down of the sun he died.
