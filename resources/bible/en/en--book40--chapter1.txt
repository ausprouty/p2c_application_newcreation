<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The book of the generation of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], the son of David (Dawad), the son of Ibrahim (Abraham).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Ibrahim (Abraham) begat Ishaq (Isaac); and Ishaq (Isaac) begat Ya’qub (Jacob); and Ya’qub (Jacob) begat Judah and his brethren; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and Jesse begat David (Dawad) the king.
<br>
And David (Dawad) begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Ya’qub (Jacob); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and Ya’qub (Jacob) begat Yosef the husband of Maryam, of whom was born Isa, who is called al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> So all the generations from Ibrahim (Abraham) unto David (Dawad) are fourteen generations; and from David (Dawad) unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto al-Masih fourteen generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Now the birth of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] was on this wise: When his mother Maryam had been betrothed to Yosef, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ruach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Yosef her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of HaAdon appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Yosef, thou son of David (Dawad), fear not to take unto thee Maryam thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ruach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by HaAdon through the prophet, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son,
<br>
And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, Elokim with us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Yosef arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of HaAdon commanded him, and took unto him his wife; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
