<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(Maschil of Asaph) Give ear, O my people, to my law:
<br>
Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I will open my mouth in a parable;
<br>
I will utter dark sayings of old,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Which we have heard and known,
<br>
And our fathers have told us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> We will not hide them from their children,
<br>
Telling to the generation to come the praises of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For he established a testimony in Ya’qub (Jacob),
<br>
And appointed a law in Israel,
<br>
Which he commanded our fathers,
<br>
That they should make them known to their children;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be born;
<br>
Who should arise and tell them to their children,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> That they might set their hope in Elokim,
<br>
And not forget the works of Elokim,
<br>
But keep his commandments,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And might not be as their fathers,
<br>
A stubborn and rebellious generation,
<br>
A generation that set not their heart aright,
<br>
And whose spirit was not stedfast with Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,
<br>
Turned back in the day of battle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> They kept not the covenant of Elokim,
<br>
And refused to walk in his law;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And they forgat his doings,
<br>
And his wondrous works that he had showed them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers,
<br>
In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through;
<br>
And he made the waters to stand as a heap.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> In the day-time also he led them with a cloud,
<br>
And all the night with a light of fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> He clave rocks in the wilderness,
<br>
And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> He brought streams also out of the rock,
<br>
And caused waters to run down like rivers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Yet went they on still to sin against him,
<br>
To rebel against the Most High in the desert.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And they tempted Elokim in their heart
<br>
By asking food according to their desire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Yea, they spoke against Elokim;
<br>
They said, Can Elokim prepare a table in the wilderness?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out,
<br>
And streams overflowed;
<br>
Can he give bread also?
<br>
Will he provide flesh for his people?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Therefore تتراجراماتون heard, and was wroth;
<br>
And a fire was kindled against Ya’qub (Jacob),
<br>
And anger also went up against Israel;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Because they believed not in Elokim,
<br>
And trusted not in his salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Yet he commanded the skies above,
<br>
And opened the doors of heaven;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And he rained down manna upon them to eat,
<br>
And gave them food from heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Man did eat the bread of the mighty:
<br>
He sent them food to the full.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens;
<br>
And by his power he guided the south wind.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> He rained flesh also upon them as the dust,
<br>
And winged birds as the sand of the seas:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp,
<br>
Round about their habitations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> So they did eat, and were well filled;
<br>
And he gave them their own desire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> They were not estranged from that which they desired,
<br>
Their food was yet in their mouths,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> When the anger of Elokim went up against them,
<br>
And slew of the fattest of them,
<br>
And smote down the young men of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For all this they sinned still,
<br>
And believed not in his wondrous works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity,
<br>
And their years in terror.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> When he slew them, then they inquired after him;
<br>
And they returned and sought Elokim earnestly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And they remembered that Elokim was their rock,
<br>
And the Most High Elokim their redeemer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> But they flattered him with their mouth,
<br>
And lied unto him with their tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> For their heart was not right with him,
<br>
Neither were they faithful in his covenant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> But he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not:
<br>
Yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
<br>
And did not stir up all his wrath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And he remembered that they were but flesh,
<br>
A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness,
<br>
And grieve him in the desert!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And they turned again and tempted Elokim,
<br>
And provoked the Holy One of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> They remembered not his hand,
<br>
Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> How he set his signs in Egypt,
<br>
And his wonders in the field of Zoan,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And turned their rivers into blood,
<br>
And their streams, so that they could not drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;
<br>
And frogs, which destroyed them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar,
<br>
And their labor unto the locust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> He destroyed their vines with hail,
<br>
And their sycomore-trees with frost.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> He gave over their cattle also to the hail,
<br>
And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger,
<br>
Wrath, and indignation, and trouble,
<br>
A band of angels of evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> He made a path for his anger;
<br>
He spared not their soul from death,
<br>
But gave their life over to the pestilence,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And smote all the first-born in Egypt,
<br>
The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> But he led forth his own people like sheep,
<br>
And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> And he led them safely, so that they feared not;
<br>
But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> He drove out the nations also before them,
<br>
And allotted them for an inheritance by line,
<br>
And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High Elokim,
<br>
And kept not his testimonies;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers:
<br>
They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> For they provoked him to anger with their high places,
<br>
And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> When Elokim heard this, he was wroth,
<br>
And greatly abhorred Israel;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh,
<br>
The tent which he placed among men;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">61</sup> And delivered his strength into captivity,
<br>
And his glory into the adversary’s hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">62</sup> He gave his people over also unto the sword,
<br>
And was wroth with his inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">63</sup> Fire devoured their young men;
<br>
And their virgins had no marriage-song.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">64</sup> Their priests fell by the sword;
<br>
And their widows made no lamentation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">65</sup> Then HaAdon awaked as one out of sleep,
<br>
Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">66</sup> And he smote his adversaries backward:
<br>
He put them to a perpetual reproach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">67</sup> Moreover he refused the tent of Yusuf (Joseph),
<br>
And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">68</sup> But chose the tribe of Judah,
<br>
The mount Zion which he loved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">69</sup> And he built his sanctuary like the heights,
<br>
Like the earth which he hath established for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">70</sup> He chose David (Dawad) also his servant,
<br>
And took him from the sheepfolds:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">71</sup> From following the ewes that have their young he brought him,
<br>
To be the shepherd of Ya’qub (Jacob) his people, and Israel his inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">72</sup> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,
<br>
And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
