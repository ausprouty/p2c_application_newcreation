<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate تتراجراماتون? for this thing wrath is upon thee from before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou hast put away the Asheroth out of the land, and hast set thy heart to seek Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill-country of Ephraim, and brought them back unto تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of their fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he set judges in the land throughout all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and said to the judges, Consider what ye do: for ye judge not for man, but for تتراجراماتون; and he is with you in the judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Now therefore let the fear of تتراجراماتون be upon you; take heed and do it: for there is no iniquity with تتراجراماتون our Elokim, nor respect of persons, nor taking of bribes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites and the priests, and of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel, for the judgment of تتراجراماتون, and for controversies. And they returned to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of تتراجراماتون, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And whensoever any controversy shall come to you from your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall warn them, that they be not guilty towards تتراجراماتون, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not be guilty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of تتراجراماتون; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you.
<br>
 Deal courageously, and تتراجراماتون be with the good.
