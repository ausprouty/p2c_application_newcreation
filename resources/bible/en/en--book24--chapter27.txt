<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, came this word unto Jeremiah from تتراجراماتون, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون to me: Make thee bonds and bars, and put them upon thy neck; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon, by the hand of the messengers that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and give them a charge unto their masters, saying, Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel, Thus shall ye say unto your masters: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I have made the earth, the men and the beasts that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and I give it unto whom it seemeth right unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field also have I given him to serve him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until the time of his own land come: and then many nations and great kings shall make him their bondman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And it shall come to pass, that the nation and the kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith تتراجراماتون, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But as for you, hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your sorcerers, that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> for they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land, and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But the nation that shall bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, that nation will I let remain in their own land, saith تتراجراماتون; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as تتراجراماتون hath spoken concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For I have not sent them, saith تتراجراماتون, but they prophesy falsely in my name; that I may drive you out, and that ye may perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith تتراجراماتون: Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of تتراجراماتون’s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city become a desolation? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But if they be prophets, and if the word of تتراجراماتون be with them, let them now make intercession to تتراجراماتون of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of تتراجراماتون, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that are left in this city,  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> yea, thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel, concerning the vessels that are left in the house of تتراجراماتون, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be, until the day that I visit them, saith تتراجراماتون; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.
