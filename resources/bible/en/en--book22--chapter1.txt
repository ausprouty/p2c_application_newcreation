<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The Song of songs, which is Solomon’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth;
<br>
For thy love is better than wine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thine oils have a goodly fragrance;
<br>
Thy name is as oil poured forth;
<br>
Therefore do the virgins [T.N. same word Isaiah 7:14] love thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Draw me; we will run after thee:
<br>
The king hath brought me into his chambers;
<br>
We will be glad and rejoice in thee;
<br>
We will make mention of thy love more than of wine:
<br>
Rightly do they love thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I am black, but comely,
<br>
Oh ye daughters of Jerusalem,
<br>
As the tents of Kedar,
<br>
As the curtains of Solomon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Look not upon me, because I am swarthy,
<br>
Because the sun hath scorched me.
<br>
My mother’s sons were incensed against me;
<br>
They made me keeper of the vineyards;
<br>
But mine own vineyard have I not kept.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth,
<br>
Where thou feedest thy flock,
<br>
Where thou makest it to rest at noon:
<br>
For why should I be as one that is veiled
<br>
Beside the flocks of thy companions?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> If thou know not, O thou fairest among women,
<br>
Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock,
<br>
And feed thy kids beside the shepherds’ tents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I have compared thee, O my love,
<br>
To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thy cheeks are comely with plaits of hair,
<br>
Thy neck with strings of jewels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> We will make thee plaits of gold
<br>
With studs of silver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> While the king sat at his table,
<br>
My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> My beloved is unto me as a bundle of myrrh,
<br>
That lieth betwixt my breasts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna-flowers
<br>
In the vineyards of En-gedi.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my love;
<br>
Behold thou art fair;
<br>
Thine eyes are as doves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant:
<br>
Also our couch is green.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The beams of our house are cedars,
<br>
And our rafters are firs.
