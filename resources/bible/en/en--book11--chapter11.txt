<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>Now king Solomon loved many foreign women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> of the nations concerning which تتراجراماتون said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go among them, neither shall they come among you; for surely they will turn away your heart after their Elokim: Solomon clave unto these in love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other Elokim; and his heart was not perfect with تتراجراماتون his Elokim, as was the heart of David (Dawad) his father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the Elokimdess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Solomon did that which was evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون, and went not fully after تتراجراماتون, as did David (Dawad) his father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Then did Solomon build a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech the abomination of the children of Ammon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And so did he for all his foreign wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And تتراجراماتون was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turned away from تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, who had appeared unto him twice, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other Elokim: but he kept not that which تتراجراماتون commanded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Wherefore تتراجراماتون said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it, for David (Dawad) thy father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but I will give one tribe to thy son, for David (Dawad) my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And تتراجراماتون raised up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For it came to pass, when David (Dawad) was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, and had smitten every male in Edom 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> (for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s servants with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran; and they took men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David (Dawad) slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit only let me depart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Elokim raised up another adversary unto him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a troop, when David (Dawad) slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, and reigned in Damascus.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, he also lifted up his hand against the king.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">:27</sup> And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breach of the city of David (Dawad) his father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valor; and Solomon saw the young man that he was industrious, and he gave him charge over all the labor of the house of Yusuf (Joseph).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; now Ahijah had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces; for thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> (but he shall have one tribe, for my servant David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the Elokimdess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the Elokim of Moab, and Milcom the Elokim of the children of Ammon; and they have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and mine ordinances, as did David (Dawad) his father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him prince all the days of his life, for David (Dawad) my servant’s sake whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> but I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David (Dawad) my servant may have a lamp alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that which is right in mine eyes, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as David (Dawad) my servant did; that I will be with thee, and will build thee a sure house, as I built for David (Dawad), and will give Israel unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And I will for this afflict the seed of David (Dawad), but not for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam; but Jeroboam arose, and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David (Dawad) his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
