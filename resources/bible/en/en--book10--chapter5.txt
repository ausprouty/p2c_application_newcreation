<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then came all the tribes of Israel to David (Dawad) unto Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and تتراجراماتون said to thee, Thou shalt be shepherd of my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David (Dawad) made a covenant with them in Hebron before تتراجراماتون: and they anointed David (Dawad) king over Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> David (Dawad) was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who spoke unto David (Dawad), saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither; thinking, David (Dawad) cannot come in hither.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Nevertheless David (Dawad) took the stronghold of Zion; the same is the city of David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And David (Dawad) said on that day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, let him get up to the watercourse, and smite the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul.
<br>
 Wherefore they say, There are the blind and the lame; he cannot come into the house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And David (Dawad) dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David (Dawad).
<br>
 And David (Dawad) built round about from Millo and inward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And David (Dawad) waxed greater and greater; for تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of hosts, was with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David (Dawad), and cedar-trees, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David (Dawad) a house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And David (Dawad) perceived that تتراجراماتون had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And David (Dawad) took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And these are the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan [T.N. This is the ancestor of Maryam the Virgin mother of Isa al-Masih, pbuh, see Luke 3:30; see the Hebrew word for "possess" in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam bat Dovid (Dawad), John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41], and Solomon [T.N. This is the ancestor of Yusuf Ben Dovid (Dawad) the step-father of Isa al-Masih pbuh, see Matthew 1:6]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David (Dawad) king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David (Dawad); and David (Dawad) heard of it, and went down to the stronghold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Now the Philistines had come and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And David (Dawad) inquired of تتراجراماتون, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And تتراجراماتون said unto David (Dawad), Go up; for I will certainly deliver the Philistines into thy hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And David (Dawad) came to Baal-perazim, and David (Dawad) smote them there; and he said, تتراجراماتون hath broken mine enemies before me, like the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they left their images there; and David (Dawad) and his men took them away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when David (Dawad) inquired of تتراجراماتون, he said, Thou shalt not go up: make a circuit behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry-trees.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then is تتراجراماتون gone out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And David (Dawad) did so, as تتراجراماتون commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gezer.
