<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(Maschil of Ethan the Ezrahite) I will sing of the lovingkindness of تتراجراماتون for ever:
<br>
With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever;
<br>
Thy faithfulness wilt thou establish in the very heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I have made a covenant with my chosen,
<br>
I have sworn unto David (Dawad) my servant:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thy seed will I establish for ever,
<br>
And build up thy throne to all generations.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O تتراجراماتون;
<br>
Thy faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For who in the skies can be compared unto تتراجراماتون?
<br>
Who among the sons of the mighty is like unto تتراجراماتون,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> A Elokim very terrible in the council of the holy ones,
<br>
And to be feared above all them that are round about him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> O تتراجراماتون Elokim of hosts,
<br>
Who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O تتراجراماتون?
<br>
And thy faithfulness is round about thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thou rulest the pride of the sea:
<br>
When the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain;
<br>
Thou hast scattered thine enemies with the arm of thy strength.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine:
<br>
The world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The north and the south, thou hast created them:
<br>
Tabor and Hermon rejoice in thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou hast a mighty arm;
<br>
Strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Righteousness and justice are the foundation of thy throne:
<br>
Lovingkindness and truth go before thy face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound:
<br>
They walk, O تتراجراماتون, in the light of thy countenance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> In thy name do they rejoice all the day;
<br>
And in thy righteousness are they exalted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For thou art the glory of their strength;
<br>
And in thy favor our horn shall be exalted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For our shield belongeth unto تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And our king to the Holy One of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Then thou spokest in vision to thy saints,
<br>
And saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty;
<br>
I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> I have found David (Dawad) my servant;
<br>
With my holy oil have I anointed him:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> With whom my hand shall be established;
<br>
Mine arm also shall strengthen him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The enemy shall not exact from him,
<br>
Nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And I will beat down his adversaries before him,
<br>
And smite them that hate him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But my faithfulness and my lovingkindness shall be with him;
<br>
And in my name shall his horn be exalted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> I will set his hand also on the sea,
<br>
And his right hand on the rivers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father,
<br>
My Elokim, and the rock of my salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> I also will make him my first-born,
<br>
The highest of the kings of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> My lovingkindness will I keep for him for evermore;
<br>
And my covenant shall stand fast with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> His seed also will I make to endure for ever,
<br>
And his throne as the days of heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> If his children forsake my law,
<br>
And walk not in mine ordinances;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> If they break my statutes,
<br>
And keep not my commandments;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Then will I visit their transgression with the rod,
<br>
And their iniquity with stripes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> But my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,
<br>
Nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> My covenant will I not break,
<br>
Nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Once have I sworn by my holiness:
<br>
I will not lie unto David (Dawad):
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> His seed shall endure for ever,
<br>
And his throne as the sun before me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> It shall be established for ever as the moon,
<br>
And as the faithful witness in the sky.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> But thou hast cast off and rejected [T.N. See Psalm 118:22 "rejected" same word. See Isaiah 53:1-12. Even though this rejection is vicarious and for their sake, men reject the anointed Masih of تتراجراماتون ], Thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> Thou hast abhorred the covenant of thy servant:
<br>
Thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> Thou hast broken down all his hedges;
<br>
Thou hast brought his strongholds to ruin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> All that pass by the way rob him:
<br>
He is become a reproach to his neighbors.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> Thou hast exalted the right hand of his adversaries;
<br>
Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Yea, thou turnest back the edge of his sword,
<br>
And hast not made him to stand in the battle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Thou hast made his brightness to cease,
<br>
And cast his throne down to the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> The days of his youth hast thou shortened:
<br>
Thou hast covered him with shame.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> How long, O تتراجراماتون? wilt thou hide thyself for ever?
<br>
How long shall thy wrath burn like fire?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> Oh remember how short my time is:
<br>
For what vanity hast thou created all the children of men!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> What man is he that shall live and not see death,
<br>
That shall deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses,
<br>
Which thou swarest unto David (Dawad) in thy faithfulness?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants;
<br>
How I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty peoples,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> Blessed be تتراجراماتون for evermore.
<br>
Amen, and Amen.
