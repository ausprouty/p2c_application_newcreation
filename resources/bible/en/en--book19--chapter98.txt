<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Psalm) Oh sing unto تتراجراماتون a new song;
<br>
For he hath done marvellous things:
<br>
His right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought salvation for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> تتراجراماتون hath made known his salvation:
<br>
His righteousness hath he openly showed in the sight of the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> He hath remembered his lovingkindness and his faithfulness toward the house of Israel:
<br>
All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Make a joyful noise unto تتراجراماتون, all the earth:
<br>
Break forth and sing for joy, yea, sing praises.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Sing praises unto تتراجراماتون with the harp;
<br>
With the harp and the voice of melody.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> With trumpets and sound of cornet
<br>
Make a joyful noise before the King, تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
<br>
The world, and they that dwell therein;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Let the floods clap their hands;
<br>
Let the hills sing for joy together
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Before تتراجراماتون; for he cometh to judge the earth:
<br>
He will judge the world with righteousness,
<br>
And the peoples with equity.
