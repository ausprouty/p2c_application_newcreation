<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Dawad) The heavens declare the glory of Elokim;
<br>
And the firmament showeth his handiwork.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Day unto day uttereth speech,
<br>
And night unto night showeth knowledge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> There is no speech nor language;
<br>
Their voice is not heard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Their line is gone out through all the earth,
<br>
And their words to the end of the world.
<br>
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
<br>
And rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> His going forth is from the end of the heavens,
<br>
And his circuit unto the ends of it;
<br>
And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The law of تتراجراماتون is perfect, restoring the soul:
<br>
The testimony of تتراجراماتون is sure, making wise the simple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The precepts of تتراجراماتون are right, rejoicing the heart:
<br>
The commandment of تتراجراماتون is pure, enlightening the eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The fear of تتراجراماتون is clean, enduring for ever:
<br>
The ordinances of تتراجراماتون are true, and righteous altogether.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold;
<br>
Sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
<br>
In keeping them there is great reward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Who can discern his errors?
<br>
Clear thou me from hidden faults.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins;
<br>
Let them not have dominion over me:
<br>
Then shall I be upright,
<br>
And I shall be clear from great transgression.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
<br>
Be acceptable in thy sight,
<br>
O تتراجراماتون, my rock, and my redeemer.
