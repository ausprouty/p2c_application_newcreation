<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with Elokim, and the Word was Elokim [T.N. See Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, <sup class="versenum">1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The same was in the beginning with Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> There came a man, sent from Elokim, whose name was John.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He was not the light, but came that he might bear witness of the light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> There was the true light, even the light which lighteth every man, coming into the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of Elokim, even to them that believe on his name: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his [the Bar Enosh's] glory, glory as of the only begotten from the [Atik Yomin] Father, see Daniel 7:13-14), full of grace and truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For the law was given through Musa; grace and truth came through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> No man hath seen Elokim at any time; the only begotten [Bar Enosh] Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], who is in the bosom of the [Atik Yomin] Father [Daniel 7:13-14], he hath declared him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they asked him, What then? Art thou IIyas (Elijah)? And he saith, I am not.
<br>
 Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us.
<br>
 What sayest thou of thyself? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of HaAdon, as said Isaiah the prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And they had been sent from the Pharisees.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not al-Masih, neither IIyas (Elijah), neither the prophet? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> even he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> On the morrow he seeth [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of Elokim, that taketh away the sin of the world! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Ruach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> and he looked upon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of Elokim! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abidest thou? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see.
<br>
 They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> One of the two that heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, al-Masih).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> He brought him unto [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
 He looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saith unto him, Follow me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Musa in the law, and the prophets, wrote, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]of Nazareth, the son of Yosef.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of Elokim; thou art King of Israel. [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1).

<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of Elokim ascending and descending upon the Bar Enosh.
