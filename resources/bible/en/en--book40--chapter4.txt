<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then was [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he afterward hungered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the tempter came and said unto him, If thou art the Son of Elokim, command that these stones become bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then the devil taketh him into the holy city; and he set him on the pinnacle of the temple, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and saith unto him, If thou art the Son of Elokim, cast thyself down: for it is written,
<br>
He shall give his angels charge concerning thee:
<br>
and,
<br>
On their hands they shall bear thee up,
<br>
Lest haply thou dash thy foot against a stone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not make trial of HaAdon thy Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Again, the devil taketh him unto an exceeding high mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and he said unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Then saith [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship HaAdon thy Elokim, and him only shalt thou serve.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Then the devil leaveth him; and behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Now when he heard that John was delivered up, he withdrew into Galilee; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
<br>
Toward the sea, beyond the Jordan,
<br>
Galilee of the Gentiles,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The people that sat in darkness
<br>
Saw a great light,
<br>
And to them that sat in the region and shadow of death,
<br>
To them did light spring up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> From that time began [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]to preach, and to say, Repent ye; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren, Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he saith unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And they straightway left the nets, and followed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And going on from thence he saw two other brethren, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets; and he called them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And they straightway left the boat and their father, and followed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]went about in all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the Holy Injil of the kingdom, and healing all manner of disease and all manner of sickness among the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And the report of him went forth into all Syria: and they brought unto him all that were sick, holden with divers diseases and torments, possessed with demons, and epileptic, and palsied; and he healed them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And there followed him great multitudes from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judaea and from beyond the Jordan.
