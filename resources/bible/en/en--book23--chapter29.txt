<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David (Dawad) encamped! add ye year to year; let the feasts come round:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> then will I distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation; and she shall be unto me as Ariel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops, and I will raise siege works against thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust; and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passeth away: yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> She shall be visited of تتراجراماتون of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And it shall be as when a hungry man dreameth, and, behold, he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Tarry ye and wonder; take your pleasure and be blind: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For تتراجراماتون hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes, the prophets; and your heads, the seers, hath he covered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And all vision is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it is sealed: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I am not learned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And HaAdon said, Forasmuch as this people draw nigh unto me, and with their mouth and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which hath been taught them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Woe unto them that hide deep their counsel from تتراجراماتون, and whose works are in the dark, and that say, Who seeth us? and who knoweth us? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay; that the thing made should say of him that made it, He made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He hath no understanding?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The meek also shall increase their joy in تتراجراماتون, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scoffer ceaseth, and all they that watch for iniquity are cut off; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> that make a man an offender in his cause, and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nought.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Therefore thus saith تتراجراماتون, who redeemed Ibrahim (Abraham), concerning the house of Ya’qub (Jacob): Ya’qub (Jacob) shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name; yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Ya’qub (Jacob), and shall stand in awe of the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> They also that err in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmur shall receive instruction.
