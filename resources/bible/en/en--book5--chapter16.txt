<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim; for in the month of Abib تتراجراماتون thy Elokim brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And thou shalt sacrifice the passover unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, of the flock and the herd, in the place which تتراجراماتون shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all thy borders seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which thou sacrificest the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim giveth thee; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> but at the place which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim shall choose, to cause his name to dwell in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest forth out of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to تتراجراماتون thy Elokim; thou shalt do no work therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: from the time thou beginnest to put the sickle to the standing grain shalt thou begin to number seven weeks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim with a tribute of a freewill-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give, according as تتراجراماتون thy Elokim blesseth thee<sup class="versenum"> 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and thou shalt rejoice before تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are in the midst of thee, in the place which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou shalt keep the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in from thy threshing-floor and from thy winepress: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Seven days shalt thou keep a feast unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim in the place which تتراجراماتون shall choose; because تتراجراماتون thy Elokim will bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt be altogether joyful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before تتراجراماتون thy Elokim in the place which he shall choose: in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles; and they shall not appear before تتراجراماتون empty: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim which he hath given thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim giveth thee, according to thy tribes; and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thou shalt not wrest justice: thou shalt not respect persons; neither shalt thou take a bribe; for a bribe doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim giveth thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Thou shalt not plant thee an Asherah of any kind of tree beside the altar of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, which thou shalt make thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar; which تتراجراماتون thy Elokim hateth.
