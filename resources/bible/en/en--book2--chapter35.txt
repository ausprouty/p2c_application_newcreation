<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Musa assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said unto them, These are the words which تتراجراماتون hath commanded, that ye should do them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of solemn rest to تتراجراماتون: whosoever doeth any work therein shall be put to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Musa spoke unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which تتراجراماتون commanded, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Take ye from among you an offering unto تتراجراماتون; whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, تتراجراماتون’s offering: gold, and silver, and brass, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood, 
<br>

<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.
<br>

<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all that تتراجراماتون hath commanded: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> the ark, and the staves thereof, the mercy-seat, and the veil of the screen; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> the table, and its staves, and all its vessels, and the showbread; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> the candlestick also for the light, and its vessels, and its lamps, and the oil for the light; 
<br>

<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> the pins of the tabernacle, and the pins of the court, and their cords; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> the finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, the holy garments for Haron (Aaron) the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they came, every one whose heart stirred him up, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and brought تتراجراماتون’s offering, for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all the service thereof, and for the holy garments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought brooches, and ear-rings, and signet-rings, and armlets, all jewels of gold; even every man that offered an offering of gold unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair, and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, brought them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Every one that did offer an offering of silver and brass brought تتراجراماتون’s offering; and every man, with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service, brought it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And all the women that were wise-hearted did spin with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, the blue, and the purple, the scarlet, and the fine linen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And all the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun the goats’ hair.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And the rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> and the spice, and the oil; for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> The children of Israel brought a freewill-offering unto تتراجراماتون; every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all the work, which تتراجراماتون had commanded to be made by Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And Musa said unto the children of Israel, See, تتراجراماتون hath called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And he hath filled him with the Spirit of Elokim, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> and to devise skilful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of skilful workmanship.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of workmanship, of the engraver, and of the skilful workman, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any workmanship, and of those that devise skilful works.
