<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Psalm of Dawad, to bring to remembrance.) O تتراجراماتون, rebuke me not in thy wrath;
<br>
Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For thine arrows stick fast in me,
<br>
And thy hand presseth me sore.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine indignation;
<br>
Neither is there any health in my bones because of my sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For mine iniquities are gone over my head:
<br>
As a heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> My wounds are loathsome and corrupt,
<br>
Because of my foolishness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I am pained and bowed down greatly;
<br>
I go mourning all the day long.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For my loins are filled with burning;
<br>
And there is no soundness in my flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I am faint and sore bruised:
<br>
I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Lord, all my desire is before thee;
<br>
And my groaning is not hid from thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> My heart throbbeth, my strength faileth me:
<br>
As for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my plague;
<br>
And my kinsmen stand afar off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> They also that seek after my life lay snares for me;
<br>
And they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things,
<br>
And meditate deceits all the day long.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But I, as a deaf man, hear not;
<br>
And I am as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Yea, I am as a man that heareth not,
<br>
And in whose mouth are no reproofs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For in thee, O تتراجراماتون, do I hope:
<br>
Thou wilt answer, O Lord my Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For I said, Lest they rejoice over me:
<br>
When my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For I am ready to fall,
<br>
And my sorrow is continually before me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For I will declare mine iniquity;
<br>
I will be sorry for my sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But mine enemies are lively, and are strong;
<br>
And they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> They also that render evil for good
<br>
Are adversaries unto me, because I follow the thing that is good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Forsake me not, O تتراجراماتون:
<br>
O my Elokim, be not far from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Make haste to help me,
<br>
O Lord, my salvation.
