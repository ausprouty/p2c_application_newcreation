<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, an apostle of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]through the will of Elokim, and Timothy our brother,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> To the saints and faithful brethren in Al-Masih that are at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from Elokim our Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> We give thanks to Elokim the Father of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], praying always for you, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> having heard of your faith in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], and of the love which ye have toward all the saints, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> because of the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the Holy Injil, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world bearing fruit and increasing, as it doth in you also, since the day ye heard and knew the grace of Elokim in truth; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> even as ye learned of Epaphras our beloved fellow-servant, who is a faithful minister of Al-Masih on our behalf, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray and make request for you, that ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> to walk worthily of HaAdon unto all pleasing, bearing fruit in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> strengthened with all power, according to the might of his glory, unto all patience and longsuffering with joy; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> giving thanks unto the Father, who made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] of his love; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> in whom we have our redemption, the forgiveness of our sins: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> who is the demut (Genesis 1:26; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Hebrews 1:3) of the invisible Elokim, the bechor (firstborn heir, Deuteronomy 21:15-17; Psalm 89:27; Matthew 28:18 presiding over) all creation. [T.N. See Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> for in him were all things created, in the heavens and upon the earth, things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers; all things have been created through him, and unto him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and he is before all things, and in him all things consist.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he is the head of the body, the New Creation Masjid: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For it was the good pleasure of the Father that in him should all the fulness dwell; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and through him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his Tree; through him, I say, whether things upon the earth, or things in the heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And you, being in time past alienated and enemies in your mind in your evil works, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and without blemish and unreproveable before him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> if so be that ye continue in the faith, grounded and stedfast, and not moved away from the hope of the Holy Injil which ye heard, which was preached in all creation under heaven; whereof I Paul was made a minister.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and fill up on my part that which is lacking of the afflictions of Al-Masih in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the New Creation Masjid; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> whereof I was made a minister, according to the dispensation of Elokim which was given me to you-ward, to fulfil the word of Elokim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> even the mystery which hath been hid for ages and generations: but now hath it been manifested to his saints, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> to whom Elokim was pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Al-Masih in you, the hope of glory: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Al-Masih; 29</sup> whereunto I labor also, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.
