<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then Ayyub (Job) answered and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> No doubt but ye are the people,
<br>
And wisdom shall die with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But I have understanding as well as you;
<br>
I am not inferior to you:
<br>
Yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbor,
<br>
I who called upon Elokim, and he answered:
<br>
The just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune;
<br>
It is ready for them whose foot slippeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The tents of robbers prosper,
<br>
And they that provoke Elokim are secure;
<br>
Into whose hand Elokim bringeth abundantly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee;
<br>
And the birds of the heavens, and they shall tell thee:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee;
<br>
And the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Who knoweth not in all these,
<br>
That the hand of تتراجراماتون hath wrought this,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,
<br>
And the breath of all mankind?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Doth not the ear try words,
<br>
Even as the palate tasteth its food?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> With aged men is wisdom,
<br>
And in length of days understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> With Elokim is wisdom and might;
<br>
He hath counsel and understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again;
<br>
He shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up;
<br>
Again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> With him is strength and wisdom;
<br>
The deceived and the deceiver are his.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He leadeth counsellors away stripped,
<br>
And judges maketh he fools.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He looseth the bond of kings,
<br>
And he bindeth their loins with a girdle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He leadeth priests away stripped,
<br>
And overthroweth the mighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> He removeth the speech of the trusty,
<br>
And taketh away the understanding of the elders.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He poureth contempt upon princes,
<br>
And looseth the belt of the strong.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> He uncovereth deep things out of darkness,
<br>
And bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> He increaseth the nations, and he destroyeth them:
<br>
He enlargeth the nations, and he leadeth them captive.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> He taketh away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth,
<br>
And causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> They grope in the dark without light;
<br>
And he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
