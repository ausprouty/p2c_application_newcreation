<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] him of the hand of the Ishmaelites, that had brought him down thither.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And تتراجراماتون was with Yusuf (Joseph), and he was a prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And his master saw that تتراجراماتون was with him, and that تتراجراماتون made all that he did to prosper in his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) found favor in his sight, and he ministered unto him: and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And it came to pass from the time that he made him overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that تتراجراماتون blessed the Egyptian’s house for Yusuf’s sake; and the blessing of تتراجراماتون was upon all that he had, in the house and in the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he left all that he had in Yusuf’s hand; and he knew not aught that was with him, save the bread which he did eat.
<br>
 And Yusuf (Joseph) was comely, and well-favored.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Yusuf (Joseph); and she said, Lie with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But he refused, and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master knoweth not what is with me in the house, and he hath put all that he hath into my hand: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> he is not greater in this house than I; neither hath he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against Elokim? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And it came to pass, as she spoke to Yusuf (Joseph) day by day, that he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And it came to pass about this time, that he went into the house to do his work; and there was none of the men of the house there within.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> that she called unto the men of her house, and spoke unto them, saying, See, he hath brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us: he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled, and got him out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And she laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to mock me:<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment by me, and fled out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner did thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the master of Yusuf (Joseph) took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were bound: and he was there in the prison.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But تتراجراماتون was with Yusuf (Joseph), and showed kindness unto him, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the keeper of the prison committed to Yusuf’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand, because تتراجراماتون was with him; and that which he did, تتراجراماتون made it to prosper.
