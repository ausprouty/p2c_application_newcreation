<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But, because of fornications, let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her own husband.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Let the husband render unto the wife her due: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The wife hath not power over her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power over his own body, but the wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Defraud ye not one the other, except it be by consent for a season, that ye may give yourselves unto prayer, and may be together again, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But this I say by way of concession, not of commandment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Yet I would that all men were even as I myself.
<br>
 Howbeit each man hath his own gift from Elokim, one after this manner, and another after that.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But I say to the unmarried and to widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But if they have not continency, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But unto the married I give charge, yea not I, but HaAdon, That the wife depart not from her husband 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> (but should she depart, let her remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her husband); and that the husband leave not his wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But to the rest say I, not HaAdon: If any brother hath an unbelieving wife, and she is content to dwell with him, let him not leave her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the woman that hath an unbelieving husband, and he is content to dwell with her, let her not leave her husband.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Yet if the unbelieving departeth, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not under bondage in such cases: but Elokim hath called us in peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For how knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O husband, whether thou shalt save thy wife? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Only, as HaAdon hath distributed to each man, as Elokim hath called each, so let him walk.
<br>
 And so ordain I in all the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Was any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.
<br>
 Hath any been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but the keeping of the commandments of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Wast thou called being a bondservant? care not for it: nay, even if thou canst become free, use it rather.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For he that was called in HaAdon being a bondservant, is HaAdon’s freedman: likewise he that was called being free, is al-Masih’s bondservant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Ye were bought with a price; become not bondservants of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Brethren, let each man, wherein he was called, therein abide with Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of HaAdon: but I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of HaAdon to be trustworthy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> I think therefore that this is good by reason of the distress that is upon us, namely, that it is good for a man to be as he is.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed.
<br>
 Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But shouldest thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned.
<br>
 Yet such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I would spare you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But this I say, brethren, the time is shortened, that henceforth both those that have wives may be as though they had none; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> and those that use the world, as not using it to the full: for the fashion of this world passeth away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> But I would have you to be free from cares.
<br>
 He that is unmarried is careful for the things of HaAdon, how he may please HaAdon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> but he that is married is careful for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> and is divided.
<br>
 So also the woman that is unmarried and the virgin is careful for the things of HaAdon, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married is careful for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And this I say for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is seemly, and that ye may attend upon HaAdon without distraction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> But if any man thinketh that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin daughter, if she be past the flower of her age, and if need so requireth, let him do what he will; he sinneth not; let them marry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> But he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power as touching his own will, and hath determined this in his own heart, to keep his own virgin daughter, shall do well.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> So then both he that giveth his own virgin daughter in marriage doeth well; and he that giveth her not in marriage shall do better.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> A wife is bound for so long time as her husband liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> But she is happier if she abide as she is, after my judgment: and I think that I also have the Spirit of Elokim.
