<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all they that know the truth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> for the truthâ€™s sake which abideth in us, and it shall be with us for ever: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Grace, mercy, peace shall be with us, from Elokim the [Atik Yomin] Father, and from [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], the [Bar Enosh] Son of the [Atik Yomin] Father, in truth and love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I rejoice greatly that I have found certain of thy children walking in truth, even as we received commandment from the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote to thee a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And this is love, that we should walk after his commandments.
<br>
 This is the commandment, even as ye heard from the beginning, that ye should walk in it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For many deceivers are gone forth into the world, even they that confess not that [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] cometh in the flesh.
<br>
 This is the deceiver and the anti-masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Look to yourselves, that ye lose not the things which we have wrought, but that ye receive a full reward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Whosoever goeth onward and abideth not in the teaching of al-Masih, hath not Elokim: he that abideth in the teaching, the same hath both the [Atik Yomin] Father and the [Bar Enosh] Son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> If any one cometh unto you, and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not into your house masjid, and give him no greeting: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> for he that giveth him greeting partaketh in his evil works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Having many things to write unto you, I would not write them with paper and ink: but I hope to come unto you, and to speak face to face, that your joy may be made full.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The children of thine elect sister salute thee.
