<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Song of Ascents) When تتراجراماتون brought back those that returned to Zion,
<br>
We were like unto them that dream.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
<br>
And our tongue with singing:
<br>
Then said they among the nations,
<br>
تتراجراماتون hath done great things for them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> تتراجراماتون hath done great things for us,
<br>
Whereof we are glad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Turn again our captivity, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
As the streams in the South.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing seed for sowing,
<br>
Shall doubtless come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with him.
