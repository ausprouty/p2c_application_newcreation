<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Is there not a warfare to man upon earth?
<br>
And are not his days like the days of a hireling?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow,
<br>
And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> So am I made to possess months of misery,
<br>
And wearisome nights are appointed to me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> When I lie down, I say,
<br>
When shall I arise, and the night be gone?
<br>
And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;
<br>
My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle,
<br>
And are spent without hope.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Oh remember that my life is a breath:
<br>
Mine eye shall no more see good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more;
<br>
Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away,
<br>
So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He shall return no more to his house,
<br>
Neither shall his place know him any more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;
<br>
I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
<br>
I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Am I a sea, or a sea-monster,
<br>
That thou settest a watch over me?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> When I say, My bed shall comfort me,
<br>
My couch shall ease my complaint;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Then thou scarest me with dreams,
<br>
And terrifiest me through visions:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So that my soul chooseth strangling,
<br>
And death rather than these my bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I loathe my life; I would not live alway:
<br>
Let me alone; for my days are vanity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him,
<br>
And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And that thou shouldest visit him every morning,
<br>
And try him every moment?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> How long wilt thou not look away from me,
<br>
Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men?
<br>
Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee,
<br>
So that I am a burden to myself?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?
<br>
For now shall I lie down in the dust;
<br>
And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.
