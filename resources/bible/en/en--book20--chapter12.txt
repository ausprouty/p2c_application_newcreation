<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Whoso loveth correction loveth knowledge;
<br>
But he that hateth reproof is brutish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> A good man shall obtain favor of تتراجراماتون;
<br>
But a man of wicked devices will he condemn.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> A man shall not be established by wickedness;
<br>
But the root of the righteous shall not be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> A worthy woman is the crown of her husband;
<br>
But she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The thoughts of the righteous are just;
<br>
But the counsels of the wicked are deceit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The words of the wicked are of lying in wait for blood;
<br>
But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The wicked are overthrown, and are not;
<br>
But the house of the righteous shall stand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> A man shall be commended according to his wisdom;
<br>
But he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and hath a servant,
<br>
Than he that honoreth himself, and lacketh bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast;
<br>
But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread;
<br>
But he that followeth after vain persons is void of understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The wicked desireth the net of evil men;
<br>
But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man;
<br>
But the righteous shall come out of trouble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth;
<br>
And the doings of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The way of a fool is right in his own eyes;
<br>
But he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> A fool’s vexation is presently known;
<br>
But a prudent man concealeth shame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He that uttereth truth showeth forth righteousness;
<br>
But a false witness, deceit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> There is that speaketh rashly like the piercings of a sword;
<br>
But the tongue of the wise is health.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The lip of truth shall be established for ever;
<br>
But a lying tongue is but for a moment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil;
<br>
But to the counsellors of peace is joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> There shall no mischief happen to the righteous;
<br>
But the wicked shall be filled with evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Lying lips are an abomination to تتراجراماتون;
<br>
But they that deal truly are his delight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> A prudent man concealeth knowledge;
<br>
But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> The hand of the diligent shall bear rule;
<br>
But the slothful shall be put under taskwork.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Heaviness in the heart of a man maketh it stoop;
<br>
But a good word maketh it glad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> The righteous is a guide to his neighbor;
<br>
But the way of the wicked causeth them to err.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting;
<br>
But the precious substance of men is to the diligent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> In the way of righteousness is life;
<br>
And in the pathway thereof there is no death.
