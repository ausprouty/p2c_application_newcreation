<sup class="versenum">1</sup> After these things the word of تتراجراماتون came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Abram said, O Lord تتراجراماتون, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and he that shall be possessor of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?<sup class="versenum">3</sup></sup> And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And, behold, the word of تتراجراماتون came unto him, saying, This man shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and number the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he believed in تتراجراماتون; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he said unto him, I am تتراجراماتون that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he said, O Lord تتراجراماتون, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old, and a she-goat three years old, and a ram three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he took him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each half over against the other: but the birds divided he not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the birds of prey came down upon the carcasses, and Abram drove them away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be sojourners in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance [T.N.This verse reminds us of  the Exodus and the Passover and Isa the Qurbani Lamb of Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29 and John 19:14-16 and the fact that Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation.]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch that passed between these pieces.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> In that day تتراجراماتون made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.
