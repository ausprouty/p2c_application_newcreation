<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of Elokim, and to heal the sick.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And into whatsoever house ye enter, there abide, and thence depart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And as many as receive you not, when ye depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the Holy Injil, and healing everywhere.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John was risen from the dead; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and by some, that IIyas (Elijah) had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto him what things they had done.
<br>
 And he took them, and withdrew apart to a city called Bethsaida.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of Elokim, and them that had need of healing he cured.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said unto him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat.
<br>
 And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we should go and buy food for all this people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For they were about five thousand men.
<br>
 And he said unto his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And they did so, and made them all sit down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the multitudes say that I am? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And they answering said, Yahya the Immerser; but others say, IIyas (Elijah); and others, that one of the old prophets is risen again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answering said, The [Bar Enosh] Son of [Atik Yomin] Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But he charged them, and commanded them to tell this to no man; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> saying, The Bar Enosh must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and the third day be raised up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he said unto all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Tree daily, and follow me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> For whosoever would save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Bar Enosh be ashamed, when he cometh in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment became white and dazzling.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Musa and IIyas (Elijah); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said unto [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Musa, and one for IIyas (Elijah): not knowing what he said.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], my chosen: hear ye him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And when the voice came, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was found alone.
<br>
 And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the things which they had seen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech thee to look upon my son; for he is mine only child: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> and behold, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departeth from him, bruising him sorely.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And I besought thy disciples to cast it out; and they could not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring hither thy son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare him grievously.
<br>
 But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And they were all astonished at the majesty of Elokim.
<br>
But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said unto his disciples, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Let these words sink into your ears: for the Bar Enosh shall be delivered up into the hands of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> But when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he followeth not with us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against you is for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he were going to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we bid fire to come down from heaven, and consume them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> But he turned, and rebuked them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> And they went to another village.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> And as they went on the way, a certain man said unto him, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests; but the Bar Enosh hath not where to lay his head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> And he said unto another, Follow me.
<br>
 But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> But he said unto him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go thou and publish abroad the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">61</sup> And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to bid farewell to them that are at my house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">62</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of Elokim.
