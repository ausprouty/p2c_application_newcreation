<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that one said to Yusuf (Joseph), Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And one told Ya’qub (Jacob), and said, Behold, thy son Yusuf (Joseph) cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) said unto Yusuf (Joseph), Elokim Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And now thy two sons, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And thy issue, that thou begettest after them, shall be thine; they shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And as for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Israel beheld Yusuf’s sons, and said, Who are these? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) said unto his father, They are my sons, whom Elokim hath given me here. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see.
<br>
 And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Israel said unto Yusuf (Joseph), I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, Elokim hath let me see thy seed also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) brought them out from between his knees; and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the first-born.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he blessed Yusuf (Joseph), and said, The Elokim before whom my fathers Ibrahim (Abraham) and Ishaq (Isaac) did walk, the Elokim who hath fed me all my life long unto this day, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> the angel who hath redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Ibrahim (Abraham) and Ishaq (Isaac); and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And when Yusuf (Joseph) saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Yusuf (Joseph) said unto his father, Not so, my father; for this is the first-born; put thy right hand upon his head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: howbeit his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, Elokim make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And Israel said unto Yusuf (Joseph), Behold, I die: but Elokim will be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
