<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The king’s heart is in the hand of تتراجراماتون as the watercourses:
<br>
He turneth it whithersoever he will.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Every way of a man is right in his own eyes;
<br>
But تتراجراماتون weigheth the hearts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> To do righteousness and justice
<br>
Is more acceptable to تتراجراماتون than sacrifice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> A high look, and a proud heart,
<br>
Even the lamp of the wicked, is sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness;
<br>
But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The getting of treasures by a lying tongue
<br>
Is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away,
<br>
Because they refuse to do justice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked;
<br>
But as for the pure, his work is right.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
<br>
Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The soul of the wicked desireth evil:
<br>
His neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise;
<br>
And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked,
<br>
How the wicked are overthrown to their ruin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor,
<br>
He also shall cry, but shall not be heard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> A gift in secret pacifieth anger;
<br>
And a present in the bosom, strong wrath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> It is joy to the righteous to do justice;
<br>
But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding
<br>
Shall rest in the assembly of the dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man:
<br>
He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The wicked is a ransom for the righteous;
<br>
And the treacherous cometh in the stead of the upright.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> It is better to dwell in a desert land,
<br>
Than with a contentious and fretful woman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise;
<br>
But a foolish man swalloweth it up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He that followeth after righteousness and kindness
<br>
Findeth life, righteousness, and honor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty,
<br>
And bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue
<br>
Keepeth his soul from troubles.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> The proud and haughty man, scoffer is his name;
<br>
He worketh in the arrogance of pride.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> The desire of the sluggard killeth him;
<br>
For his hands refuse to labor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> There is that coveteth greedily all the day long;
<br>
But the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination;
<br>
How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> A false witness shall perish;
<br>
But the man that heareth shall speak so as to endure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> A wicked man hardeneth his face;
<br>
But as for the upright, he establisheth his ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> There is no wisdom nor understanding
<br>
Nor counsel against تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> The horse is prepared against the day of battle;
<br>
But victory is of تتراجراماتون.
