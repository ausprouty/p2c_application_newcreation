<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Yea, at this my heart trembleth,
<br>
And is moved out of its place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice,
<br>
And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven,
<br>
And his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> After it a voice roareth;
<br>
He thundereth with the voice of his majesty;
<br>
And he restraineth not the lightnings when his voice is heard.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Elokim thundereth marvellously with his voice;
<br>
Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth;
<br>
Likewise to the shower of rain,
<br>
And to the showers of his mighty rain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He sealeth up the hand of every man,
<br>
That all men whom he hath made may know it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then the beasts go into coverts,
<br>
And remain in their dens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm,
<br>
And cold out of the north.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> By the breath of Elokim ice is given;
<br>
And the breadth of the waters is straitened.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture;
<br>
He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And it is turned round about by his guidance,
<br>
That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them
<br>
Upon the face of the habitable world,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Whether it be for correction, or for his land,
<br>
Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Hearken unto this, O Ayyub (Job):
<br>
Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Dost thou know how Elokim layeth his charge upon them,
<br>
And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds,
<br>
The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> How thy garments are warm,
<br>
When the earth is still by reason of the south wind?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Canst thou with him spread out the sky,
<br>
Which is strong as a molten mirror?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Teach us what we shall say unto him;
<br>
For we cannot set our speech in order by reason of darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Shall it be told him that I would speak?
<br>
Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies;
<br>
But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Out of the north cometh golden splendor:
<br>
Elokim hath upon him terrible majesty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out:
<br>
He is excellent in power;
<br>
And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Men do therefore fear him:
<br>
He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.
