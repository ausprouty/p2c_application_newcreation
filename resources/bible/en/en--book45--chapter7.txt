<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Or are ye ignorant, brethren (for I speak to men who know the law), that the law hath dominion over a man for so long time as he liveth?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For the woman that hath a husband is bound by law to the husband while he liveth; but if the husband die, she is discharged from the law of the husband.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> So then if, while the husband liveth, she be joined to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the husband die, she is free from the law, so that she is no adulteress, though she be joined to another man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Wherefore, my brethren, ye also were made dead to the law through the body of al-Masih; that ye should be joined to another, even to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bring forth fruit unto Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions, which were through the law, wrought in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that wherein we were held; so that we serve in newness of the spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Elokim forbid.
<br>
 Howbeit, I had not known sin, except through the law: for I had not known coveting, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> but sin, finding occasion, wrought in me through the commandment all manner of coveting: for apart from the law sin is dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And I was alive apart from the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and the commandment, which was unto life, this I found to be unto death: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> for sin, finding occasion, through the commandment beguiled me, and through it slew me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So that the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and righteous, and good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Did then that which is good become death unto me? Elokim forbid.
<br>
 But sin, that it might be shown to be sin, by working death to me through that which is good;â€™that through the commandment sin might become exceeding sinful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For that which I do I know not: for not what I would, that do I practise; but what I hate, that I do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But if what I would not, that I do, I consent unto the law that it is good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> So now it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me, but to do that which is good is not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For the good which I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I practise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But if what I would not, that I do, it is no more I that do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> I find then the law, that, to me who would do good, evil is present.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For I delight in the law of Elokim after the inward man: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity under the law of sin which is in my members.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> I thank Elokim through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] our Lord.
<br>
 So then I of myself with the mind, indeed, serve the law of Elokim; but with the flesh the law of sin.
