<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> It is of تتراجراماتون’s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> تتراجراماتون is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> تتراجراماتون is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> For HaAdon will not cast off for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> To subvert a man in his cause, HaAdon approveth not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when HaAdon commandeth it not?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto Elokim in the heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Thou hast made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> Till تتراجراماتون look down, and behold from heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> I called upon thy name, O تتراجراماتون, out of the lowest dungeon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> O تتراجراماتون, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">61</sup> Thou hast heard their reproach, O تتراجراماتون, and all their devices against me,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">62</sup> The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">63</sup> Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">64</sup> Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O تتراجراماتون, according to the work of their hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">65</sup> Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">66</sup> Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of تتراجراماتون.
