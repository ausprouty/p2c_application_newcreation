<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Send thou men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a prince among them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Musa sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of تتراجراماتون: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Yusuf (Joseph).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Of the tribe of Yusuf (Joseph), namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> These are the names of the men that Musa sent to spy out the land.
<br>
 And Musa called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And Musa sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this way by the South, and go up into the hill-country: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not.
<br>
 And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land.
<br>
 Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And they went up by the South, and came unto Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there.
<br>
 (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And they came unto the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it upon a staff between two; they brought also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And they returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And they went and came to Musa, and to Haron (Aaron), and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us; and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Howbeit the people that dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, and very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Amalek dwelleth in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill-country; and the Canaanite dwelleth by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And Caleb stilled the people before Musa, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.
