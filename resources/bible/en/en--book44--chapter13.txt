<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now there were at Antioch, in the New Creation Masjid that was there, prophets and teachers, Barnabas, and Symeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And as they ministered to HaAdon, and fasted, the Holy Ruach said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">4</sup> So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ruach, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And when they were at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of Elokim in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as their attendant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And when they had gone through the whole island unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Bar-Jesus; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of understanding.
<br>
 The same called unto him Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn aside the proconsul from the faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But Saul, who is also called Paul, filled with the Holy Ruach, fastened his eyes on him, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and said, O full of all guile and all villany, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of HaAdon? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And now, behold, the hand of HaAdon is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season.
<br>
 And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Now Paul and his company set sail from Paphos, and came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia; and they went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And Paul stood up, and beckoning with the hand said,
<br>
Men of Israel, and ye that fear Elokim, hearken: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The Elokim of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they sojourned in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm led he them forth out of it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And for about the time of forty years as a nursing-father bare he them in the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land for an inheritance, for about four hundred and fifty years: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and after these things he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And afterward they asked for a king: and Elokim gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And when he had removed him, he raised up David (Dawad) to be their king; to whom also he bare witness and said, I have found David (Dawad) the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my will.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Of this manâ€™s seed hath Elokim according to promise brought unto Israel a Saviour, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> when John had first preached before his coming the total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3) of repentance to all the people of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, What suppose ye that I am? I am not he.
<br>
 But behold, there cometh one after me the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to unloose.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Brethren, children of the stock of Ibrahim (Abraham), and those among you that fear Elokim, to us is the word of this salvation sent forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For they that dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And though they found no cause of death in him, yet asked they of Pilate that he should be slain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And when they had fulfilled all things that were written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> But Elokim raised him from the dead: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> and he was seen for many days of them that came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses unto the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And we bring you good tidings of the promise made unto the fathers, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> that Elokim hath fulfilled the same unto our children, in that he raised up [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]; as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], this day have I begotten thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he hath spoken on this wise, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Because he saith also in another psalm, Thou wilt not give thy Holy One to see corruption.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> For David (Dawad), after he had in his own generation served the counsel of Elokim, fell asleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> but he whom Elokim raised up saw no corruption.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is proclaimed unto you remission of sins: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> and by him every one that believeth is justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> Beware therefore, lest that come upon you which is spoken in the prophets:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish;
<br>
For I work a work in your days,
<br>
A work which ye shall in no wise believe, if one declare it unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And as they went out, they besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them, urged them to continue in the grace of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And the next sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together to hear the word of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken by Paul, and blasphemed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, It was necessary that the word of Elokim should first be spoken to you.
<br>
 Seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> For so hath HaAdon commanded us, saying,
<br>
I have set thee for a light of the Gentiles,
<br>
That thou shouldest be for salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And as the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of Elokim: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And the word of HaAdon was spread abroad throughout all the region.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> But the Jews urged on the devout women of honorable estate, and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of their borders.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ruach.
