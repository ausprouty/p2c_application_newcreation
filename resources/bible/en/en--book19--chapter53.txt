<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; set to Mahalath. Maschil of Dawad). The fool hath said in his heart, There is no Elokim. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity;
<br>
There is none that doeth good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Elokim looked down from heaven upon the children of men,
<br>
To see if there were any that did understand,
<br>
That did seek after Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Every one of them is gone back; they are together become filthy;
<br>
There is none that doeth good, no, not one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge,
<br>
Who eat up my people as they eat bread,
<br>
And call not upon Elokim?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> There were they in great fear, where no fear was;
<br>
For Elokim hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee:
<br>
Thou hast put them to shame, because Elokim hath rejected them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion!
<br>
When Elokim bringeth back the captivity of his people,
<br>
Then shall Yaâ€™qub (Jacob) rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
