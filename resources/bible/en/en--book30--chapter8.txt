<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Thus HaAdon تتراجراماتون showed me: and, behold, a basket of summer fruit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit.
<br>
 Then said تتراجراماتون unto me, The end is come upon my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: the dead bodies shall be many; in every place shall they cast them forth with silence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Hear this, O ye that would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell grain? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and dealing falsely with balances of deceit; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> that we may buy [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes, and sell the refuse of the wheat? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> تتراجراماتون hath sworn by the excellency of Ya’qub (Jacob), Surely I will never forget any of their works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein? yea, it shall rise up wholly like the River; and it shall be troubled and sink again, like the River of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring sackcloth upon all loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning for an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Behold, the days come, saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of تتراجراماتون, and shall not find it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> In that day shall the fair virgins and the young men faint for thirst.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, As thy Elokim, O Dan, liveth; and, As the way of Beer-sheba liveth; they shall fall, and never rise up again.
