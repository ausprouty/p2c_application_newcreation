<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> تتراجراماتون is a jealous Elokim and avengeth; تتراجراماتون avengeth and is full of wrath; تتراجراماتون taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> تتراجراماتون is slow to anger, and great in power, and will by no means clear the guilty [T.N. This gives the rationale behind the urgency of Isaiah 53:11 which says of al-Masih, He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of him (see John 14:9) shall my righteous servant justify many (see Romans 5:1; Genesis 15:6; Habakkuk 2:4. Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:28; Galatians 3:24. No al-Salaam peace with تتراجراماتون without faith in Masih and depending on him alone to be put right with تتراجراماتون; and, yes, true faith is active in love, Galatians 5:6; James 2:14, 17, 20, 26; Ephesians 2:10). We see from Exodus 12:13 the token in that verse that points to Isaiah 53:7 and John 14:6 and constitutes the token of justification (Romans 5:9) and admission to heaven.] تتراجراماتون hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon languisheth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt; and the earth is upheaved at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken asunder by him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> تتراجراماتون is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and he knoweth them that take refuge in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But with an over-running flood he will make a full end of her place, and will pursue his enemies into darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> What do ye devise against تتراجراماتون? he will make a full end; affliction shall not rise up the second time.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For entangled like thorns, and drunken as with their drink, they are consumed utterly as dry stubble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> There is one gone forth out of thee, that deviseth evil against تتراجراماتون, that counselleth wickedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: Though they be in full strength, and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away.
<br>
 Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And تتراجراماتون hath given commandment concerning thee, that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy Elokim will I cut off the graven image and the molten image; I will make thy grave; for thou art vile.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Behold, upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace! Keep thy feasts, O Judah, perform thy vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
