<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And they brought in the ark of Elokim, and set it in the midst of the tent that David (Dawad) had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And when David (Dawad) had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of تتراجراماتون, and to celebrate and to thank and praise تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Then on that day did David (Dawad) first ordain to give thanks unto تتراجراماتون, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> O give thanks unto تتراجراماتون, call upon his name;
<br>
Make known his doings among the peoples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Sing unto him, sing praises unto him;
<br>
Talk ye of all his marvellous works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Glory ye in his holy name;
<br>
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Seek ye تتراجراماتون and his strength;
<br>
Seek his face evermore.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done,
<br>
His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> O ye seed of Israel his servant,
<br>
Ye children of Ya’qub (Jacob), his chosen ones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> He is تتراجراماتون our Elokim;
<br>
His judgments are in all the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Remember his covenant for ever,
<br>
The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The covenant which he made with Ibrahim (Abraham),
<br>
And his oath unto Ishaq (Isaac),
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And confirmed the same unto Ya’qub (Jacob) for a statute,
<br>
To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
<br>
The lot of your inheritance;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> When ye were but a few men in number,
<br>
Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And they went about from nation to nation,
<br>
And from one kingdom to another people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He suffered no man to do them wrong;
<br>
Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones,
<br>
And do my prophets no harm.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Sing unto تتراجراماتون, all the earth;
<br>
Show forth his salvation from day to day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Declare his glory among the nations,
<br>
His marvellous works among all the peoples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For great is تتراجراماتون, and greatly to be praised:
<br>
He also is to be feared above all Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For all the Elokim of the peoples are idols:
<br>
But تتراجراماتون made the heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Honor and majesty are before him:
<br>
Strength and gladness are in his place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Ascribe unto تتراجراماتون, ye kindreds of the peoples,
<br>
Ascribe unto تتراجراماتون glory and strength;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Ascribe unto تتراجراماتون the glory due unto his name:
<br>
Bring an offering, and come before him;
<br>
Worship تتراجراماتون in holy array.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Tremble before him, all the earth:
<br>
The world also is established that it cannot be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice;
<br>
And let them say among the nations, تتراجراماتون reigneth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof;
<br>
Let the field exult, and all that is therein;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before تتراجراماتون;
<br>
For he cometh to judge the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> O give thanks unto تتراجراماتون; for he is good;
<br>
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And say ye, Save us, O Elokim of our salvation,
<br>
And gather us together and deliver us from the nations,
<br>
To give thanks unto thy holy name,
<br>
And to triumph in thy praise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Blessed be تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel,
<br>
From everlasting even to everlasting.
<br>
And all the people said, Amen, and praised تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of تتراجراماتون in the high place that was at Gibeon, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> to offer burnt-offerings unto تتراجراماتون upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of تتراجراماتون, which he commanded unto Israel; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to تتراجراماتون, because his lovingkindness endureth for ever; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of Elokim; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And all the people departed every man to his house: and David (Dawad) returned to bless his house.
