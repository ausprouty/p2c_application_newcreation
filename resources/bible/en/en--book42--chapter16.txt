<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he said also unto the disciples, There was a certain rich man, who had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he was wasting his goods.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he called him, and said unto him, What is this that I hear of thee? render the account of thy stewardship; for thou canst be no longer steward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the steward said within himself, What shall I do, seeing that my lord taketh away the stewardship from me? I have not strength to dig; to beg I am ashamed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And calling to him each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he said, A hundred measures of oil.
<br>
 And he said unto him, Take thy bond, and sit down quickly and write fifty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat.
<br>
 He saith unto him, Take thy bond, and write fourscore.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And his lord commended the unrighteous steward because he had done wisely: for the sons of this world are for their own generation wiser than the sons of the light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends by means of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when it shall fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He that is faithful in a very little is faithful also in much: and he that is unrighteous in a very little is unrighteous also in much.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another’s, who will give you that which is your own? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to one, and despise the other.
<br>
 Ye cannot serve Elokim and mammon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things; and they scoffed at him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he said unto them, Ye are they that justify yourselves in the sight of men; but Elokim knoweth your hearts: for that which is exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The law and the prophets were until John: from that time the Holy Injil of the kingdom of Elokim is preached, and every man entereth violently into it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one tittle of the law to fall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Every one that putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth one that is put away from a husband committeth adultery.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Now there was a certain rich man, and he was clothed in purple and fine linen, faring sumptuously every day: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and a certain beggar named Lazarus was laid at his gate, full of sores,<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and desiring to be fed with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table; yea, even the dogs came and licked his sores.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and that he was carried away by the angels into Ibrahim (Abraham)’s bosom: and the rich man also died, and was buried.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Ibrahim (Abraham) afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And he cried and said, Father Ibrahim (Abraham), have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am in anguish in this flame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But Ibrahim (Abraham) said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But Ibrahim (Abraham) saith, They have Musa and the prophets; let them hear them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And he said, Nay, father Ibrahim (Abraham): but if one go to them from the dead, they will repent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And he said unto him, If they hear not Musa and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, if one rise from the dead.
