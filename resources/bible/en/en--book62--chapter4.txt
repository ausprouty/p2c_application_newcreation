<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of Elokim; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hereby know ye the Spirit of Elokim: every spirit that confesseth that [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] is come in the flesh is of Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and every spirit that confesseth not [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]is not of Elokim: and this is the spirit of the antimasih, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Ye are of Elokim, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They are of the world: therefore speak they as of the world, and the world heareth them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> We are of Elokim: he that knoweth Elokim heareth us; he who is not of Elokim heareth us not.
<br>
 By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of Elokim; and every one that loveth is begotten of Elokim, and knoweth Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He that loveth not knoweth not Elokim; for Elokim is love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Herein was the love of Elokim manifested in us, that Elokim hath sent his only begotten Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] into the world that we might live through him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Herein is love, not that we loved Elokim, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Beloved, if Elokim so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> No man hath beheld Elokim at any time: if we love one another, Elokim abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Whosoever shall confess that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]is the Son of Elokim, Elokim abideth in him, and he in Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And we know and have believed the love which Elokim hath in us.
<br>
 Elokim is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in Elokim, and Elokim abideth in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> We love, because he first loved us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> If a man say, I love Elokim, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love Elokim whom he hath not seen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth Elokim love his brother also.
