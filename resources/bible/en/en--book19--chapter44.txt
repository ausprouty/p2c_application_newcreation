<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. Maschil) We have heard with our ears, O Elokim,
<br>
Our fathers have told us,
<br>
What work thou didst in their days,
<br>
In the days of old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thou didst drive out the nations with thy hand;
<br>
But them thou didst plant:
<br>
Thou didst afflict the peoples;
<br>
But them thou didst spread abroad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword,
<br>
Neither did their own arm save them;
<br>
But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance,
<br>
Because thou wast favorable unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thou art my King, O Elokim:
<br>
Command deliverance for Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Through thee will we push down our adversaries:
<br>
Through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For I will not trust in my bow,
<br>
Neither shall my sword save me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But thou hast saved us from our adversaries,
<br>
And hast put them to shame that hate us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> In Elokim have we made our boast all the day long,
<br>
And we will give thanks unto thy name for ever.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But now thou hast cast us off, and brought us to dishonor,
<br>
And goest not forth with our hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thou makest us to turn back from the adversary;
<br>
And they that hate us take spoil for themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Thou hast made us like sheep appointed for food,
<br>
And hast scattered us among the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Thou sellest thy people for nought,
<br>
And hast not increased thy wealth by their price.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbors,
<br>
A scoffing and a derision to them that are round about us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thou makest us a byword among the nations,
<br>
A shaking of the head among the peoples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> All the day long is my dishonor before me,
<br>
And the shame of my face hath covered me,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth,
<br>
By reason of the enemy and the avenger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
<br>
Neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Our heart is not turned back,
<br>
Neither have our steps declined from thy way,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> That thou hast sore broken us in the place of jackals,
<br>
And covered us with the shadow of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> If we have forgotten the name of our Elokim,
<br>
Or spread forth our hands to a strange Elokim;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Will not Elokim search this out?
<br>
For he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long;
<br>
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?
<br>
Arise, cast us not off for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Wherefore hidest thou thy face,
<br>
And forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For our soul is bowed down to the dust:
<br>
Our body cleaveth unto the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Rise up for our help,
<br>
And redeem us for thy lovingkindness’ sake.
