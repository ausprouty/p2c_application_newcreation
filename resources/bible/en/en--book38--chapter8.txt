<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And the word of تتراجراماتون of hosts came to me, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called The city of truth; and the mountain of تتراجراماتون of hosts, The holy mountain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: There shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, every man with his staff in his hand for very age.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: If it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvellous in mine eyes? saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: Behold, I will save my people from the east country, and from the west country; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their Elokim, in truth and in righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye that hear in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets that were in the day that the foundation of the house of تتراجراماتون of hosts was laid, even the temple, that it might be built.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in, because of the adversary: for I set all men every one against his neighbor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in the former days, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For there shall be the seed of peace; the vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its increase, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And it shall come to pass that, as ye were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing.
<br>
 Fear not, but let your hands be strong.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: As I thought to do evil unto you, when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, and I repented not; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> so again have I thought in these days to do good unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> These are the things that ye shall do: speak ye every man the truth with his neighbor; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And the word of تتراجراماتون of hosts came unto me, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love truth and peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: It shall yet come to pass, that there shall come peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to entreat the favor of تتراجراماتون, and to seek تتراجراماتون of hosts: I will go also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Yea, many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek تتراجراماتون of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold, out of all the languages of the nations, they shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with you, for we have heard that Elokim is with you.
