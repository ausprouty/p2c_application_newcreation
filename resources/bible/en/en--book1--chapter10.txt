<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, namely, of Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup></sup> And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the sons of Ham: Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the sons of Cush: Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah: Sheba, and Dedan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He was a mighty hunter before تتراجراماتون: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and Pathrusim, and Casluhim (whence went forth the Philistines), and Caphtorim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Canaan begat Sidon his first-born, and Heth, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgashite, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanite spread abroad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the border of the Canaanite was from Sidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Hud (Eber), the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The sons of Shem: Elam, and Asshur, and Arpachshad, and Lud, and Aram.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And the sons of Aram: Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Hud (Eber).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And unto Hud (Eber) were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> and Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> and Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> and Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
