<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then Ayyub (Job) answered and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> How long will ye vex my soul,
<br>
And break me in pieces with words?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> These ten times have ye reproached me:
<br>
Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And be it indeed that I have erred,
<br>
Mine error remaineth with myself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me,
<br>
And plead against me my reproach;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Know now that Elokim hath subverted me in my cause,
<br>
And hath compassed me with his net.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard:
<br>
I cry for help, but there is no justice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass,
<br>
And hath set darkness in my paths.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He hath stripped me of my glory,
<br>
And taken the crown from my head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone;
<br>
And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He hath also kindled his wrath against me,
<br>
And he counteth me unto him as one of his adversaries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> His troops come on together,
<br>
And cast up their way against me,
<br>
And encamp round about my tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He hath put my brethren far from me,
<br>
And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> My kinsfolk have failed,
<br>
And my familiar friends have forgotten me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger:
<br>
I am an alien in their sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer,
<br>
Though I entreat him with my mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> My breath is strange to my wife,
<br>
And my supplication to the children of mine own mother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Even young children despise me;
<br>
If I arise, they speak against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> All my familiar friends abhor me,
<br>
And they whom I loved are turned against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh,
<br>
And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends;
<br>
For the hand of Elokim hath touched me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Why do ye persecute me as Elokim,
<br>
And are not satisfied with my flesh?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Oh that my words were now written!
<br>
Oh that they were inscribed in a book!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> That with an iron pen and lead
<br>
They were graven in the rock for ever!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth,
<br>
And at last he will stand up upon the earth:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And after my skin, even this body, is destroyed,
<br>
Yet in my flesh shall I see Elokim;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side,
<br>
And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger.
<br>
My heart is consumed within me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> If ye say, How we will persecute him!
<br>
And that the root of the matter is found in me;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Be ye afraid of the sword:
<br>
For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword,
<br>
That ye may know there is a judgment.
<br>
