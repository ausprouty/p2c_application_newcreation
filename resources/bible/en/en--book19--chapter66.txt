<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. A song, a Psalm) Make a joyful noise unto Elokim, all the earth:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Sing forth the glory of his name:
<br>
Make his praise glorious.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Say unto Elokim, How terrible are thy works!
<br>
Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> All the earth shall worship thee,
<br>
And shall sing unto thee;
<br>
They shall sing to thy name.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Come, and see the works of Elokim;
<br>
He is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He turned the sea into dry land;
<br>
They went through the river on foot:
<br>
There did we rejoice in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He ruleth by his might for ever;
<br>
His eyes observe the nations:
<br>
Let not the rebellious exalt themselves.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Oh bless our Elokim, ye peoples,
<br>
And make the voice of his praise to be heard;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Who holdeth our soul in life,
<br>
And suffereth not our feet to be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For thou, O Elokim, hast proved us:
<br>
Thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Thou broughtest us into the net;
<br>
Thou layedst a sore burden upon our loins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Thou didst cause men to ride over our heads;
<br>
We went through fire and through water;
<br>
But thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings;
<br>
I will pay thee my vows,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Which my lips uttered,
<br>
And my mouth spoke, when I was in distress.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> I will offer unto thee burnt-offerings of fatlings,
<br>
With the incense of rams;
<br>
I will offer bullocks with goats.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Come, and hear, all ye that fear Elokim,
<br>
And I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> I cried unto him with my mouth,
<br>
And he was extolled with my tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> If I regard iniquity in my heart,
<br>
HaAdon will not hear:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But verily Elokim hath heard;
<br>
He hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Blessed be Elokim,
<br>
Who hath not turned away my prayer,
<br>
Nor his lovingkindness from me.
