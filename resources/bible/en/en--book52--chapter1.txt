<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the New Creation Masjid of the Thessalonians in Elokim the [Atik Yomin] Father and [Bar Enosh] HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] [T.N. See Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41]: Grace to you and Al-Salaam.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> We give thanks to Elokim always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], before our Elokim and Father; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> knowing, brethren beloved of Elokim, your election, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> how that our Holy Injil came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ruach, and in much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And ye became imitators of us, and of HaAdon, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ruach; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For from you hath sounded forth the word of HaAdon, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to Elokim-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto Elokim from idols, to serve a living and true Elokim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and to wait for his Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], who delivereth us from the wrath to come.
