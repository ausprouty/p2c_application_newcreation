<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, See, I have made thee as Elokim to Pharaoh; and Haron (Aaron) thy brother shall be thy prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thou shalt speak all that I command thee; and Haron (Aaron) thy brother shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> But Pharaoh will not hearken unto you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my hosts, my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the Egyptians shall know that I am تتراجراماتون, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) did so; as تتراجراماتون commanded them, so did they.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Musa was fourscore years old, and Haron (Aaron) fourscore and three years old, when they spoke unto Pharaoh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa and unto Haron (Aaron), saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Show a wonder for you; then thou shalt say unto Haron (Aaron), Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so, as تتراجراماتون had commanded: and Haron (Aaron) cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers: and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Haron (Aaron)’s rod swallowed up their rods.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as تتراجراماتون had spoken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Pharaoh’s heart is stubborn, he refuseth to let the people go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink to meet him; and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thy hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And thou shalt say unto him, تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of the Hebrews, hath sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون, In this thou shalt know that I am تتراجراماتون: behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Say unto Haron (Aaron), Take thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools, and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) did so, as تتراجراماتون commanded; and he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river; and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he hearkened not unto them; as تتراجراماتون had spoken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And seven days were fulfilled, after that تتراجراماتون had smitten the river.
