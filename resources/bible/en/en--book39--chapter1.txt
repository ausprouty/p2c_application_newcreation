<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The burden of the word of تتراجراماتون to Israel by Malachi.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I have loved you, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
 Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Ya’qub’s brother? saith تتراجراماتون: yet I loved Ya’qub (Jacob); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom تتراجراماتون hath indignation for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, تتراجراماتون be magnified beyond the border of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith تتراجراماتون of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of تتراجراماتون is contemptible.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of Elokim, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the Gentiles, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of تتراجراماتون is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto HaAdon a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles.
