<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Come now, ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that are coming upon you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Your gold and your silver are rusted; and their rust shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh as fire.
<br>
 Ye have laid up your treasure in the last days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Behold, the hire of the laborers who mowed your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth out: and the cries of them that reaped have entered into the ears of HaAdon of Sabaoth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Ye have lived delicately on the earth, and taken your pleasure; ye have nourished your hearts in a day of slaughter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Ye have condemned, ye have killed the righteous one; he doth not resist you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of HaAdon. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient over it, until it receive the early and latter rain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Be ye also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of HaAdon is at hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Murmur not, brethren, one against another, that ye be not judged: behold, the judge standeth before the doors.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Take, brethren, for an example of suffering and of patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Behold, we call them blessed that endured: ye have heard of the patience of Ayyub (Job), and have seen the end of HaAdon, how that HaAdon is full of pity, and merciful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by the heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that ye fall not under judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Is any among you suffering? let him pray. Is any cheerful? let him sing praise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Is any among you sick? let him call for the elders of the New Creation Masjid; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of HaAdon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and the prayer of faith shall save him that is sick, and HaAdon shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, it shall be forgiven him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Confess therefore your sins one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The supplication of a righteous man availeth much in its working.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> IIyas (Elijah) was a man of like passions with us, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth for three years and six months.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he prayed again; and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> My brethren, if any among you err from the truth, and one convert him;  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> let him know, that he who converteth a sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.
