<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Bless تتراجراماتون, O my soul.
<br>
O تتراجراماتون my Elokim, thou art very great;
<br>
Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment;
<br>
Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters;
<br>
Who maketh the clouds his chariot;
<br>
Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Who maketh winds his messengers;
<br>
Flames of fire his ministers;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Who laid the foundations of the earth,
<br>
That it should not be moved for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture;
<br>
The waters stood above the mountains.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> At thy rebuke they fled;
<br>
At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> (The mountains rose, the valleys sank down)
<br>
Unto the place which thou hadst founded for them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over;
<br>
That they turn not again to cover the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He sendeth forth springs into the valleys;
<br>
They run among the mountains;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> They give drink to every beast of the field;
<br>
The wild asses quench their thirst.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> By them the birds of the heavens have their habitation;
<br>
They sing among the branches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He watereth the mountains from his chambers:
<br>
The earth is filled with the fruit of thy works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle,
<br>
And herb for the service of man;
<br>
That he may bring forth food out of the earth,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And wine that maketh glad the heart of man,
<br>
And oil to make his face to shine,
<br>
And bread that strengtheneth man’s heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The trees of تتراجراماتون are filled with moisture,
<br>
The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Where the birds make their nests:
<br>
As for the stork, the fir-trees are her house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The high mountains are for the wild goats;
<br>
The rocks are a refuge for the conies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He appointed the moon for seasons:
<br>
The sun knoweth his going down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Thou makest darkness, and it is night,
<br>
Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The young lions roar after their prey,
<br>
And seek their food from Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The sun ariseth, they get them away,
<br>
And lay them down in their dens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Man goeth forth unto his work
<br>
And to his labor until the evening.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> O تتراجراماتون, how manifold are thy works!
<br>
In wisdom hast thou made them all:
<br>
The earth is full of thy riches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Yonder is the sea, great and wide,
<br>
Wherein are things creeping innumerable,
<br>
Both small and great beasts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> There go the ships;
<br>
There is leviathan, whom thou hast formed to play therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> These wait all for thee,
<br>
That thou mayest give them their food in due season.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Thou givest unto them, they gather;
<br>
Thou openest thy hand, they are satisfied with good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled;
<br>
Thou takest away their breath, they die,
<br>
And return to their dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created;
<br>
And thou renewest the face of the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Let the glory of تتراجراماتون endure for ever;
<br>
Let تتراجراماتون rejoice in his works:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Who looketh on the earth, and it trembleth;
<br>
He toucheth the mountains, and they smoke.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> I will sing unto تتراجراماتون as long as I live:
<br>
I will sing praise to my Elokim while I have any being.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Let my meditation be sweet unto him:
<br>
I will rejoice in تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.
<br>
And let the wicked be no more.
<br>
Bless تتراجراماتون, O my soul.
<br>
Praise ye تتراجراماتون.
<br>
