<sup class="versenum">1</sup> How is the gold become dim! how is the most pure gold changed!
<br>
The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold,
<br>
How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones:
<br>
The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst:
<br>
The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets:
<br>
They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom,
<br>
That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk;
<br>
They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets:
<br>
Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger;
<br>
For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children;
<br>
They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> تتراجراماتون hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger;
<br>
And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world,
<br>
That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,
<br>
That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood,
<br>
So that men cannot touch their garments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not!
<br>
When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn here.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The anger of تتراجراماتون hath scattered them; he will no more regard them:
<br>
They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Our eyes do yet fail in looking for our vain help:
<br>
In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets:
<br>
Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens:
<br>
They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of تتراجراماتون, was taken in their pits;
<br>
Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz:
<br>
The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity:
<br>
He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.
