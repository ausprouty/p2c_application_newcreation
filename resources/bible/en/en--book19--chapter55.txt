<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. Maschil of Dawad) Give ear to my prayer, O Elokim;
<br>
And hide not thyself from my supplication.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Attend unto me, and answer me:
<br>
I am restless in my complaint, and moan,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Because of the voice of the enemy,
<br>
Because of the oppression of the wicked;
<br>
For they cast iniquity upon me,
<br>
And in anger they persecute me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> My heart is sore pained within me:
<br>
And the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me,
<br>
And horror hath overwhelmed me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!
<br>
Then would I fly away, and be at rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Lo, then would I wander far off,
<br>
I would lodge in the wilderness.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I would haste me to a shelter
<br>
From the stormy wind and tempest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongue;
<br>
For I have seen violence and strife in the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
<br>
Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Wickedness is in the midst thereof:
<br>
Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For it was not an enemy that reproached me;
<br>
Then I could have borne it:
<br>
Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me;
<br>
Then I would have hid myself from him:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But it was thou, a man mine equal,
<br>
My companion, and my familiar friend.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> We took sweet counsel together;
<br>
We walked in the house of Elokim with the throng.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Let death come suddenly upon them,
<br>
Let them go down alive into Sheol;
<br>
For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> As for me, I will call upon Elokim;
<br>
And تتراجراماتون will save me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan;
<br>
And he will hear my voice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me;
<br>
For they were many that strove with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Elokim will hear, and answer them,
<br>
Even he that abideth of old,
<br>
Selah
<br>
The men who have no changes,
<br>
And who fear not Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him:
<br>
He hath profaned his covenant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> His mouth was smooth as butter,
<br>
But his heart was war:
<br>
His words were softer than oil,
<br>
Yet were they drawn swords.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Cast thy burden upon تتراجراماتون, and he will sustain thee:
<br>
He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But thou, O Elokim, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction:
<br>
Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days;
<br>
But I will trust in thee.
