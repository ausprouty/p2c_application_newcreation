<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from Elokim; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except Elokim be with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, even the Bar Enosh, who is in heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And as Musa lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Bar Enosh be lifted up; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For Elokim so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For Elokim sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> After these things came [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and gave a total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3) .
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And John also was baptizing [T.N. See 2 Kings 5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that God can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (Romans 6:3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .] in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> For John was not yet cast into prison.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John’s disciples with a Jew about purifying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not al-Masih, but, that I am sent before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> He must increase, but I must decrease.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to this, that Elokim is true.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> For he whom Elokim hath sent speaketh the words of Elokim: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of Elokim abideth on him.
