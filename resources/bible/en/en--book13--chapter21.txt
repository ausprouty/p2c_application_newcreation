<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David (Dawad) to number Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And David (Dawad) said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring me word, that I may know the sum of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Joab said, تتراجراماتون make his people a hundred times as many as they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? why doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of guilt unto Israel? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab.
<br>
 Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David (Dawad).
<br>
 And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Elokim was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto Elokim, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Gad, David’s seer, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Go and speak unto David (Dawad), saying, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> So Gad came to David (Dawad), and said unto him, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, Take which thou wilt: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of تتراجراماتون, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of تتراجراماتون destroying throughout all the borders of Israel.
<br>
 Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of تتراجراماتون; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> So تتراجراماتون sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Elokim sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, تتراجراماتون beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand.
<br>
 And the angel of تتراجراماتون was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And David (Dawad) lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of تتراجراماتون standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem.
<br>
 Then David (Dawad) and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto Elokim, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O تتراجراماتون my Elokim, be against me, and against my father’s house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Then the angel of تتراجراماتون commanded Gad to say to David (Dawad), that David (Dawad) should go up, and rear an altar unto تتراجراماتون in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And David (Dawad) went up at the saying of Gad, which he spoke in the name of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves.
<br>
 Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And as David (Dawad) came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David (Dawad), and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David (Dawad) with his face to the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Then David (Dawad) said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto تتراجراماتون: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Ornan said unto David (Dawad), Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And king David (Dawad) said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for تتراجراماتون, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> So David (Dawad) gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And David (Dawad) built there an altar unto تتراجراماتون, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon تتراجراماتون; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And تتراجراماتون commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> At that time, when David (Dawad) saw that تتراجراماتون had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For the tabernacle of تتراجراماتون, which Musa made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> But David (Dawad) could not go before it to inquire of Elokim; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of تتراجراماتون.
