<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Elokim, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the prophets by divers portions and in divers manners,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> hath at the end of these days spoken unto us in his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the worlds; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> who being the effulgence of his glory, and the very demut [T.N. See Genesis 1::26; 2 Corinthians 4:4; Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> having become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For unto which of the angels said he at any time,
<br>
Thou art my Son,
<br>
This day have I begotten thee?
<br>
and again,
<br>
I will be to him a Father,
<br>
And he shall be to me a Son?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the world he saith, And let all the angels of Elokim worship him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And of the angels he saith,
<br>
Who maketh his angels winds,
<br>
And his ministers a flame of fire:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> but of the Son he saith,
<br>
Thy throne, O Elokim, is for ever and ever;
<br>
And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;
<br>
Therefore Elokim, thy Elokim, hath anointed thee
<br>
With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And,
<br>
Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the earth,
<br>
And the heavens are the works of thy hands:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> They shall perish; but thou continuest:
<br>
And they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And as a mantle shalt thou roll them up,
<br>
As a garment, and they shall be changed:
<br>
But thou art the same,
<br>
And thy years shall not fail.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But of which of the angels hath he said at any time,
<br>
Sit thou on my right hand,
<br>
Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation?
