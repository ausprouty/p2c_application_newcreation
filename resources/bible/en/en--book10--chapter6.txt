<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And David (Dawad) again gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And David (Dawad) arose, and went with all the people that were with him, from Baale-judah, to bring up from thence the ark of Elokim, which is called by the Name, even the name of تتراجراماتون of hosts that sitteth above the cherubim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And they set the ark of Elokim upon a new cart, and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in the hill: and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was in the hill, with the ark of Elokim: and Ahio went before the ark.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And David (Dawad) and all the house of Israel played before تتراجراماتون with all manner of instruments made of fir-wood, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with castanets, and with cymbals.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And when they came to the threshing-floor of Nacon, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of Elokim, and took hold of it; for the oxen stumbled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the anger of تتراجراماتون was kindled against Uzzah; and Elokim smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And David (Dawad) was displeased, because تتراجراماتون had broken forth upon Uzzah; and he called that place Perez-uzzah, unto this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And David (Dawad) was afraid of تتراجراماتون that day; and he said, How shall the ark of تتراجراماتون come unto me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> So David (Dawad) would not remove the ark of تتراجراماتون unto him into the city of David (Dawad); but David (Dawad) carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the ark of تتراجراماتون remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite three months: and تتراجراماتون blessed Obed-edom, and all his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And it was told king David (Dawad), saying, تتراجراماتون hath blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that pertaineth unto him, because of the ark of Elokim.
<br>
 And David (Dawad) went and brought up the ark of Elokim from the house of Obed-edom into the city of David (Dawad) with joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And it was so, that, when they that bare the ark of تتراجراماتون had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And David (Dawad) danced before تتراجراماتون with all his might; and David (Dawad) was girded with a linen ephod.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So David (Dawad) and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of تتراجراماتون with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And it was so, as the ark of تتراجراماتون came into the city of David (Dawad), that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David (Dawad) leaping and dancing before تتراجراماتون; and she despised him in her heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And they brought in the ark of تتراجراماتون, and set it in its place, in the midst of the tent that David (Dawad) had pitched for it; and David (Dawad) offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And when David (Dawad) had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins.
<br>
 So all the people departed every one to his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Then David (Dawad) returned to bless his household.
<br>
 And Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David (Dawad), and said, How glorious was the king of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself to-day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto Michal, It was before تتراجراماتون, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over the people of تتراجراماتون, over Israel: therefore will I play before تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And I will be yet more vile than this, and will be base in mine own sight: but of the handmaids of whom thou hast spoken, of them shall I be had in honor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.
