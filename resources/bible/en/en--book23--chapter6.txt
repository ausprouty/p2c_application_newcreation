<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In the year that king Uzziah died I saw HaAdon sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is تتراجراماتون of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And I heard the voice of HaAdon, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and تتراجراماتون have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And if there be yet a tenth in it, it also shall in turn be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.
