<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> My son, if thou wilt receive my words,
<br>
And lay up my commandments with thee;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom,
<br>
And apply thy heart to understanding;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Yea, if thou cry after discernment,
<br>
And lift up thy voice for understanding;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> If thou seek her as silver,
<br>
And search for her as for hid treasures:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then shalt thou understand the fear of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And find the knowledge of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For تتراجراماتون giveth wisdom;
<br>
Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright;
<br>
He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> That he may guard the paths of justice,
<br>
And preserve the way of his saints.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice,
<br>
And equity, yea, every good path.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For wisdom shall enter into thy heart,
<br>
And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Discretion shall watch over thee;
<br>
Understanding shall keep thee:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> To deliver thee from the way of evil,
<br>
From the men that speak perverse things;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Who forsake the paths of uprightness,
<br>
To walk in the ways of darkness;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Who rejoice to do evil,
<br>
And delight in the perverseness of evil;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Who are crooked in their ways,
<br>
And wayward in their paths:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> To deliver thee from the strange woman,
<br>
Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> That forsaketh the friend of her youth,
<br>
And forgetteth the covenant of her Elokim:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For her house inclineth unto death,
<br>
And her paths unto the dead;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> None that go unto her return again,
<br>
Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> That thou mayest walk in the way of good men,
<br>
And keep the paths of the righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For the upright shall dwell in the land,
<br>
And the perfect shall remain in it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But the wicked shall be cut off from the land,
<br>
And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.
