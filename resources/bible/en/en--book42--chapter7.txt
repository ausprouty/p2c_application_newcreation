<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> After he had ended all his sayings in the ears of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick and at the point of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And when he heard concerning [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], he sent unto him elders of the Jews, asking him that he would come and save his servant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And they, when they came to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], besought him earnestly, saying, He is worthy that thou shouldest do this for him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> for he loveth our nation, and himself built us our synagogue.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]went with them.
<br>
 And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself; for I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say the word, and my servant shall be healed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For I also am a man set under authority, having under myself soldiers: and I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned and said unto the multitude that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And it came to pass soon afterwards, that he went to a city called Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great multitude.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Now when he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, there was carried out one that was dead, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And when HaAdon saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he came nigh and touched the bier: and the bearers stood still.
<br>
 And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak.
<br>
 And he gave him to his mother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And fear took hold on all: and they glorified Elokim, saying, A great prophet is arisen among us: and, Elokim hath visited his people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And this report went forth concerning him in the whole of Judaea, and all the region round about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And the disciples of John told him of all these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to HaAdon, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And when the men were come unto him, they said, Yahya the Immerser hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that cometh, or look we for another? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> In that hour he cured many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits; and on many that were blind he bestowed sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And he answered and said unto them, Go and tell John the things which ye have seen and heard; the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, the poor have good tidings preached to them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And blessed is he, whosoever shall find no occasion of stumbling in me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken with the wind? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> This is he of whom it is written,
<br>
Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
<br>
Who shall prepare thy way before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there is none greater than John: yet he that is but little in the kingdom of Elokim is greater than he.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And all the people when they heard, and the publicans, justified Elokim, being baptized with the total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3) of John.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> But the Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of Elokim, being not baptized of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation, and to what are they like? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> They are like unto children that sit in the marketplace, and call one to another; who say, We piped unto you, and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not weep.
<br>
 33	 For Yahya the Immerser is come eating no bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a demon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> The Bar Enosh is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold, a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And wisdom is justified of all her children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him.
<br>
 And he entered into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And behold, a woman who was in the city, a sinner; and when she knew that he was sitting at meat in the Pharisee’s house, she brought an alabaster cruse of ointment, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> and standing behind at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> Now when the Pharisee that had bidden him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have perceived who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, that she is a sinner.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee.
<br>
 And he saith, Teacher, say on.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> A certain lender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred shillings, and the other fifty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> When they had not wherewith to pay, he forgave them both.
<br>
 Which of them therefore will love him most? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Simon answered and said, He, I suppose, to whom he forgave the most.
<br>
 And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And turning to the woman, he said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath wetted my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Thou gavest me no kiss: but she, since the time I came in, hath not ceased to kiss my feet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but she hath anointed my feet with ointment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that even forgiveth sins? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And he said unto the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.
