<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from تتراجراماتون, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Stand in the gate of تتراجراماتون’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of تتراجراماتون, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of تتراجراماتون, the temple of تتراجراماتون, the temple of تتراجراماتون, are these.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute justice between a man and his neighbor; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> if ye oppress not the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other Elokim to your own hurt: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, from of old even for evermore [T.N. Here we see the folly of relying on religion rather than what we are told to rely on. See Romans 5:1; Genesis 15:6; Habakkuk 2:4. Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:28; Galatians 3:24. No al-Salaam peace without faith in al-Masih and depending on him alone to be put right with تتراجراماتون ].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other Elokim that ye have not known, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered; that ye may do all these abominations? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, I, even I, have seen it, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And now, because ye have done all these works, saith تتراجراماتون, and I spoke unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> therefore will I do unto the house which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Shiloh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me; for I will not hear thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead the dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other Elokim, that they may provoke me to anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Do they provoke me to anger? saith تتراجراماتون; do they not provoke themselves, to the confusion of their own faces? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Therefore thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: Behold, mine anger and my wrath shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel: Add your burnt-offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat ye flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> but this thing I commanded them, saying, Hearken unto my voice, and I will be your Elokim, and ye shall be my people; and walk ye in all the way that I command you, that it may be well with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in their own counsels and in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day, I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff: they did worse than their fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not answer thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation that hath not hearkened to the voice of تتراجراماتون their Elokim, nor received instruction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Cut off thy hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on the bare heights; for تتراجراماتون hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> For the children of Judah have done that which is evil in my sight, saith تتراجراماتون: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither came it into my mind.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith تتراجراماتون, that it shall no more be called Topheth, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of Slaughter: for they shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And the dead bodies of this people shall be food for the birds of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; for the land shall become a waste.
