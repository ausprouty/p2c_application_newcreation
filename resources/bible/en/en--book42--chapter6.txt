<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now it came to pass on a sabbath, that he was going through the grainfields; and his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But certain of the Pharisees said, Why do ye that which it is not lawful to do on the sabbath day? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answering them said, Have ye not read even this, what David (Dawad) did, when he was hungry, he, and they that were with him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> how he entered into the house of Elokim, and took and ate the showbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not lawful to eat save for the priests alone? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he said unto them, The Bar Enosh is lord of the sabbath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And it came to pass on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue and taught: and there was a man there, and his right hand was withered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the scribes and the Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find how to accuse him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But he knew their thoughts; and he said to the man that had his hand withered, Rise up, and stand forth in the midst.
<br>
 And he arose and stood forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, I ask you, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to destroy it? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he looked round about on them all, and said unto him, Stretch forth thy hand.
<br>
 And he did so: and his hand was restored.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But they were filled with madness; and communed one with another what they might do to [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And it came to pass in these days, that he went out into the mountain to pray; and he continued all night in prayer to Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And when it was day, he called his disciples; and he chose from them twelve, whom also he named apostles: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James and John, and Philip and Bartholomew, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and Matthew and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon who was called the Zealot, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and he came down with them, and stood on a level place, and a great multitude of his disciples, and a great number of the people from all Judaea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and they that were troubled with unclean spirits were healed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And all the multitude sought to touch him; for power came forth from him, and healed them all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed are ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled.
<br>
 Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you from their company, and reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Bar Enosh’s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy: for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for in the same manner did their fathers unto the prophets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Woe unto you, ye that are full now! for ye shall hunger.
<br>
 Woe unto you, ye that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for in the same manner did their fathers to the false prophets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But I say unto you that hear, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> bless them that curse you, pray for them that despitefully use you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> To him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other; and from him that taketh away thy cloak withhold not thy coat also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Give to every one that asketh thee; and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And as ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And if ye love them that love you, what thank have ye? for even sinners love those that love them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And if ye do good to them that do good to you, what thank have ye? for even sinners do the same.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive, what thank have ye? even sinners lend to sinners, to receive again as much.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> But love your enemies, and do them good, and lend, never despairing; and your reward shall be great, and ye shall be sons of the Most High: for he is kind toward the unthankful and evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Be ye merciful, even as your Father is merciful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And judge not, and ye shall not be judged: and condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned: release, and ye shall be released: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, shall they give into your bosom.
<br>
 For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And he spoke also a parable unto them, Can the blind guide the blind? shall they not both fall into a pit? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> The disciple is not above his teacher: but every one when he is perfected shall be as his teacher.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me cast out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> For there is no good tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit; nor again a corrupt tree that bringeth forth good fruit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> For each tree is known by its own fruit.
<br>
 For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth that which is evil: for out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> Every one that cometh unto me, and heareth my words, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> he is like a man building a house, who digged and went deep, and laid a foundation upon the rock: and when a flood arose, the stream brake against that house, and could not shake it: because it had been well builded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> But he that heareth, and doeth not, is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation; against which the stream brake, and straightway it fell in; and the ruin of that house was great.
