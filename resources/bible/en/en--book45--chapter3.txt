<sup class="versenum">1</sup> What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of Elokim? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Elokim forbid: yea, let Elokim be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written,
<br>
That thou mightest be justified in thy words,
<br>
And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of Elokim, what shall we say? Is Elokim unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Elokim forbid: for then how shall Elokim judge the world? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But if the truth of Elokim through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> as it is written,
<br>
There is none righteous, no, not one;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> There is none that understandeth,
<br>
There is none that seeketh after Elokim;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable;
<br>
There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Their throat is an open sepulchre;
<br>
With their tongues they have used deceit:
<br>
The poison of asps is under their lips:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Their feet are swift to shed blood;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Destruction and misery are in their ways;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the way of peace have they not known:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> There is no fear of Elokim before their eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of Elokim: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law cometh the knowledge of sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But now apart from the law a righteousness of Elokim hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> even the righteousness of Elokim through faith in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> whom Elokim set forth to be a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> for the showing, I say, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Where then is the glorying? It is excluded.
<br>
 By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Or is Elokim the Elokim of Jews only? is he not the Elokim of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> if so be that Elokim is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? Elokim forbid: nay, we establish the law.
