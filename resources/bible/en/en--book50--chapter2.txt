<sup class="versenum">1</sup> If there is therefore any exhortation in Al-Masih, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> doing nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Have this mind in you, which was also in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> who, existing in the form of Elokim, counted not the being on an equality with Elokim a thing to be grasped, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the Tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Wherefore also Elokim highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> that in the name of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and that every tongue should confess that [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] is Lord, to the glory of Elokim the Father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> for it is Elokim who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Do all things without murmurings and questionings: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of Elokim without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Al-Masih, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But I hope in HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For they all seek their own, not the things of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child serveth a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Holy Injil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> but I trust in HaAdon that I myself also shall come shortly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but Elokim had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Receive him therefore in HaAdon with all joy; and hold such in honor: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> because for the work of Al-Masih he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.
