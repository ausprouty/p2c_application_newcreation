<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto Elokim; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and exhortation, and consolation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the New Creation Masjid may receive edifying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without signification.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I thank Elokim, I speak with tongues more than you all: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> howbeit in the New Creation Masjid I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Brethren, be not children in mind: yet in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> If therefore the whole New Creation Masjid be assembled together and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship Elokim, declaring that Elokim is among you indeed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation.
<br>
 Let all things be done unto edifying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> If any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let one interpret: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the New Creation Masjid; and let him speak to himself, and to Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others discern.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> for Elokim is not a Elokim of confusion, but of peace.
<br>
As in all the New Creation Masjid of the saints, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> let the women keep silence in the New Creation Masjid: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> What? was it from you that the word of Elokim went forth? or came it unto you alone?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> But let all things be done decently and in order.
