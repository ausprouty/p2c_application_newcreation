<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there who had his hand withered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered, Stand forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand.
<br>
 And he stretched it forth; and his hand was restored.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed; and from Judaea, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond the Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he spoke to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he charged them much that they should not make him known.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth unto him whom he himself would; and they went unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and to have authority to cast out demons: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and Simon he surnamed Peter; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananean, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
<br>
And he cometh into a house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the scribes that came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons casteth he out the demons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And if Satan hath risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But no one can enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Verily I say unto you, All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Ruach hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And there come his mother and his brethren; and, standing without, they sent unto him, calling him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And he answereth them, and saith, Who is my mother and my brethren? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And looking round on them that sat round about him, he saith, Behold, my mother and my brethren! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> For whosoever shall do the will of Elokim, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
