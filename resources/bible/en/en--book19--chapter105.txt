<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Oh give thanks unto تتراجراماتون, call upon his name;
<br>
Make known among the peoples his doings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Sing unto him, sing praises unto him;
<br>
Talk ye of all his marvelous works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Glory ye in his holy name:
<br>
Let the heart of them rejoice that seek تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Seek ye تتراجراماتون and his strength;
<br>
Seek his face evermore.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Remember his marvellous works that he hath done,
<br>
His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> O ye seed of Ibrahim (Abraham) his servant,
<br>
Ye children of Ya’qub (Jacob), his chosen ones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He is تتراجراماتون our Elokim:
<br>
His judgments are in all the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He hath remembered his covenant for ever,
<br>
The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The covenant which he made with Ibrahim (Abraham),
<br>
And his oath unto Ishaq (Isaac),
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And confirmed the same unto Ya’qub (Jacob) for a statute,
<br>
To Israel for an everlasting covenant,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan,
<br>
The lot of your inheritance;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> When they were but a few men in number,
<br>
Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And they went about from nation to nation,
<br>
From one kingdom to another people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> He suffered no man to do them wrong;
<br>
Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones,
<br>
And do my prophets no harm.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And he called for a famine upon the land;
<br>
He brake the whole staff of bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He sent a man before them;
<br>
Yusuf (Joseph) was sold for a servant:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> His feet they hurt with fetters:
<br>
He was laid in chains of iron,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Until the time that his word came to pass,
<br>
The word of تتراجراماتون tried him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> The king sent and loosed him;
<br>
Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He made him lord of his house,
<br>
And ruler of all his substance;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> To bind his princes at his pleasure,
<br>
And teach his elders wisdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Israel also came into Egypt;
<br>
And Ya’qub (Jacob) sojourned in the land of Ham.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And he increased his people greatly,
<br>
And made them stronger than their adversaries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> He turned their heart to hate his people,
<br>
To deal subtly with his servants.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> He sent Musa his servant,
<br>
And Haron (Aaron) whom he had chosen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> They set among them his signs,
<br>
And wonders in the land of Ham.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> He sent darkness, and made it dark;
<br>
And they rebelled not against his words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> He turned their waters into blood,
<br>
And slew their fish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Their land swarmed with frogs
<br>
In the chambers of their kings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,
<br>
And lice in all their borders.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> He gave them hail for rain,
<br>
And flaming fire in their land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> He smote their vines also and their fig-trees,
<br>
And brake the trees of their borders.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> He spoke, and the locust came,
<br>
And the grasshopper, and that without number,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And did eat up every herb in their land,
<br>
And did eat up the fruit of their ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> He smote also all the first-born in their land,
<br>
The chief of all their strength.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And he brought them forth with silver and gold;
<br>
And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Egypt was glad when they departed;
<br>
For the fear of them had fallen upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> He spread a cloud for a covering,
<br>
And fire to give light in the night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> They asked, and he brought quails,
<br>
And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out;
<br>
They ran in the dry places like a river.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> For he remembered his holy word,
<br>
And Ibrahim (Abraham) his servant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And he brought forth his people with joy,
<br>
And his chosen with singing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And he gave them the lands of the nations;
<br>
And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> That they might keep his statutes,
<br>
And observe his laws.
<br>
Praise ye تتراجراماتون.
