<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death; for they feared the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Satan entered into Judas who was called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he went away, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might deliver him unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he consented, and sought opportunity to deliver him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the day of unleavened bread came, on which the passover must be sacrificed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and make ready for us the passover, that we may eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we make ready? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house whereinto he goeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And ye shall say unto the master of the house, The Teacher saith unto thee, Where is the guest-chamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he will show you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the apostles with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And he said unto them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover [T.N.This verse reminds us of  the Exodus and the Passover and Isa the Qurbani Lamb of Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29 and John 19:14-16 and the fact that Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation] with you before I suffer: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> for I say unto you, I shall not eat it, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And he received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> for I say unto you, I shall not drink from henceforth of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of Elokim shall come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the cup in like manner after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, even that which is poured out for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For the Bar Enosh indeed goeth, as it hath been determined: but woe unto that man through whom he is betrayed! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And they began to question among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And there arose also a contention among them, which of them was accounted to be greatest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles have lordship over them; and they that have authority over them are called Benefactors.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> But ye shall not be so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For which is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am in the midst of you as he that serveth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> and I appoint unto you a kingdom, even as my Father appointed unto me, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom; and ye shall sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> but I made supplication for thee, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, when once thou hast turned again, establish thy brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And he said unto him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, until thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And he said unto them, When I sent you forth without purse, and wallet, and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And he said unto them, But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet; and he that hath none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> For I say unto you, that this which is written must be fulfilled in me, And he was reckoned with transgressors: for that which concerneth me hath fulfilment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords.
<br>
 And he said unto them, It is enough.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And he came out, and went, as his custom was, unto the mount of Olives; and the disciples also followed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And he was parted from them about a stone’s cast; and he kneeled down and prayed, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And there appeared unto him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became as it were great drops of blood falling down upon the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And when he rose up from his prayer, he came unto the disciples, and found them sleeping for sorrow, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> While he yet spoke, behold, a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them; and he drew near unto [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]to kiss him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Bar Enosh with a kiss? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And when they that were about him saw what would follow, they said, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> And a certain one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and struck off his right ear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said, Suffer ye them thus far.
<br>
 And he touched his ear, and healed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and elders, that were come against him, Are ye come out, as against a robber, with swords and staves? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched not forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> And they seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house.
<br>
 But Peter followed afar off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and had sat down together, Peter sat in the midst of them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> And a certain maid seeing him as he sat in the light of the fire, and looking stedfastly upon him, said, This man also was with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> But he denied, saying, Woman, I know him not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou also art one of them.
<br>
 But Peter said, Man, I am not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">59</sup> And after the space of about one hour another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this man also was with him; for he is a Galilean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">60</sup> But Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.
<br>
 And immediately, while he yet spoke, the cock crew.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">61</sup> And HaAdon turned, and looked upon Peter.
<br>
 And Peter remembered the word of HaAdon, how that he said unto him, Before the cock crow this day thou shalt deny me thrice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">62</sup> And he went out, and wept bitterly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">63</sup> And the men that held [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]mocked him, and beat him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">64</sup> And they blindfolded him, and asked him, saying, Prophesy: who is he that struck thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">65</sup> And many other things spoke they against him, reviling him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">66</sup> And as soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes; and they led him away into their council, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">67</sup> If thou art al-Masih, tell us.
<br>
 But he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">68</sup> and if I ask you, ye will not answer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">69</sup> But from henceforth shall the Bar Enosh be seated at the right hand of the power of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">70</sup> And they all said, Art thou then the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)]? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">71</sup> And they said, What further need have we of witness? for we ourselves have heard from his own mouth.
