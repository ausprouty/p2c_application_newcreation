<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Israel is a luxuriant vine, that putteth forth his fruit: according to the abundance of his fruit he hath multiplied his altars; according to the goodness of their land they have made goodly pillars.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Their heart is divided; now shall they be found guilty: he will smite their altars, he will destroy their pillars.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Surely now shall they say, We have no king; for we fear not تتراجراماتون; and the king, what can he do for us?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> They speak vain words, swearing falsely in making covenants: therefore judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in terror for the calves of Beth-aven; for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced over it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> It also shall be carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> As for Samaria, her king is cut off, as foam upon the water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood; the battle against the children of iniquity doth not overtake them in Gibeah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> When it is my desire, I will chastise them; and the peoples shall be gathered against them, when they are bound to their two transgressions.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Ephraim is a heifer that is taught, that loveth to tread out the grain; but I have passed over upon her fair neck: I will set a rider on Ephraim; Judah shall plow, Ya’qub (Jacob) shall break his clods.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap according to kindness; break up your fallow ground; for it is time to seek تتراجراماتون, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies; for thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces with her children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: at daybreak shall the king of Israel be utterly cut off.
