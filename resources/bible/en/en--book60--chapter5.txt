<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of al-Masih, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Tend the flock of Elokim which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according to the will of Elokim; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder.
<br>
 Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for Elokim resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of Elokim, that he may exalt you in due time; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the Elokim of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in al-Masih, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, establish, strengthen you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> To him be the dominion for ever and ever.
<br>
 Amen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of Elokim: stand ye fast therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> She that is in Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Salute one another with a kiss of love.
<br>
Peace be unto you all that are in al-Masih.
