<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the New Creation Masjid that is at Cenchrea:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> that ye receive her in HaAdon, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a helper of many, and of mine own self.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-workers in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> who for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the New Creation Masjid of the Gentiles: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and salute the New Creation Masjid that is in their house.
<br>
 Salute Epenetus my beloved, who is the firstfruits of Asia unto Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Salute Mary, who bestowed much labor on you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Al-Masih before me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Salute Ampliatus my beloved in HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Al-Masih, and Stachys my beloved.

 All the New Creation Masjid of Al-Masih salute you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them that are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned: and turn away from them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For they that are such serve not al-Masih Adoneinu, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For your obedience is come abroad unto all men.
<br>
 I rejoice therefore over you: but I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple unto that which is evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And the Elokim of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
<br>
The grace of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] be with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Timothy my fellow-worker saluteth you; and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> I Tertius, who write the epistle, salute you in HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Gaius my host, and of the whole New Creation Masjid, saluteth you.
<br>
 Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus the brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> The grace of Adoneinu Isa al-Masih be with you all. Amen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Now to him that is able to establish you according to my Holy Injil and the preaching of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal Elokim, is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> to the only wise Elokim, through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.
