<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David (Dawad) and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of تتراجراماتون; and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds between thine arms? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that is my fellow, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; and I will turn my hand upon the little ones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith تتراجراماتون, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the third shall be left therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is tried.
<br>
 They shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people; and they shall say, تتراجراماتون is my Elokim.
