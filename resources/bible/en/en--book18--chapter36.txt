<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Elihu also proceeded, and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Suffer me a little, and I will show thee;
<br>
For I have yet somewhat to say on Elokimâ€™s behalf.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I will fetch my knowledge from afar,
<br>
And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For truly my words are not false:
<br>
One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Behold, Elokim is mighty, and despiseth not any:
<br>
He is mighty in strength of understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He preserveth not the life of the wicked,
<br>
But giveth to the afflicted their right.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous:
<br>
But with kings upon the throne
<br>
He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And if they be bound in fetters,
<br>
And be taken in the cords of affliction;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then he showeth them their work,
<br>
And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He openeth also their ear to instruction,
<br>
And commandeth that they return from iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> If they hearken and serve him,
<br>
They shall spend their days in prosperity,
<br>
And their years in pleasures.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword,
<br>
And they shall die without knowledge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But they that are Godless in heart lay up anger:
<br>
They cry not for help when he bindeth them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> They die in youth,
<br>
And their life perisheth among the unclean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction,
<br>
And openeth their ear in oppression.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress
<br>
Into a broad place, where there is no straitness;
<br>
And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked:
<br>
Judgment and justice take hold on thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements;
<br>
Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Will thy cry avail, that thou be not in distress,
<br>
Or all the forces of thy strength?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Desire not the night,
<br>
When peoples are cut off in their place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Take heed, regard not iniquity:
<br>
For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Behold, Elokim doeth loftily in his power:
<br>
Who is a teacher like unto him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Who hath enjoined him his way?
<br>
Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Remember that thou magnify his work,
<br>
Whereof men have sung.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> All men have looked thereon;
<br>
Man beholdeth it afar off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Behold, Elokim is great, and we know him not;
<br>
The number of his years is unsearchable.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For he draweth up the drops of water,
<br>
Which distil in rain from his vapor,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Which the skies pour down
<br>
And drop upon man abundantly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds,
<br>
The thunderings of his pavilion?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Behold, he spreadeth his light around him;
<br>
And he covereth the bottom of the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> For by these he judgeth the peoples;
<br>
He giveth food in abundance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> He covereth his hands with the lightning,
<br>
And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> The noise thereof telleth concerning him,
<br>
The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.
