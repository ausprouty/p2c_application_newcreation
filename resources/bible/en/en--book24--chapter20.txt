<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now Pashhur, the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of تتراجراماتون, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks.
<br>
 Then said Jeremiah unto him, تتراجراماتون hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it; and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies; and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> O تتراجراماتون, thou hast persuaded me, and I was persuaded; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughing-stock all the day, every one mocketh me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction! because the word of تتراجراماتون is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot contain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side.
<br>
 Denounce, and we will denounce him, say all my familiar friends, they that watch for my fall; peradventure he will be persuaded, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But تتراجراماتون is with me as a mighty one and a terrible: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be utterly put to shame, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonor which shall never be forgotten.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But, O تتراجراماتون of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the heart and the mind, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Sing unto تتراجراماتون, praise ye تتراجراماتون; for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man-child is born unto thee; making him very glad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And let that man be as the cities which تتراجراماتون overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontime; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother would have been my grave, and her womb always great.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
