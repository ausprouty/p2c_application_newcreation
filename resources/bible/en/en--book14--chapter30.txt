<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of تتراجراماتون at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had not sanctified themselves in sufficient number, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And the thing was right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, at Jerusalem: for they had not kept it in great numbers in such sort as it is written.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), Ishaq (Isaac), and Israel, that he may return to the remnant that are escaped of you out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, who trespassed against تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of their fathers, so that he gave them up to desolation, as ye see.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were; but yield yourselves unto تتراجراماتون, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath sanctified for ever, and serve تتراجراماتون your Elokim, that his fierce anger may turn away from you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For if ye turn again unto تتراجراماتون, your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that led them captive, and shall come again into this land: for تتراجراماتون your Elokim is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye return unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> So the posts passed from city to city through the country of Ephraim and Manasseh, even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Nevertheless certain men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Also upon Judah came the hand of Elokim to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the brook Kidron.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and sanctified themselves, and brought burnt-offerings into the house of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And they stood in their place after their order, according to the law of Musa the man of Elokim: the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the Levites.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For there were many in the assembly that had not sanctified themselves: therefore the Levites had the charge of killing the passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it is written.
<br>
 For Hezekiah had prayed for them, saying, The good تتراجراماتون pardon every one 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> that setteth his heart to seek Elokim, تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of his fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And تتراجراماتون hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised تتراجراماتون day by day, singing with loud instruments unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Hezekiah spoke comfortably unto all the Levites that had good understanding in the service of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
 So they did eat throughout the feast for the seven days, offering sacrifices of peace-offerings, and making confession to تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of their fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days; and they kept other seven days with gladness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the assembly for offerings a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the assembly a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And all the assembly of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> So there was great joy in Jerusalem; for since the time of Solomon the son of David (Dawad) king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto heaven.
