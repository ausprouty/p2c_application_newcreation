<sup class="versenum">1</sup> On that day went [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]out of the house, and sat by the sea side.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And there were gathered unto him great multitudes, so that he entered into a boat, and sat; and all the multitude stood on the beach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he spoke to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and as he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the birds came and devoured them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and others fell upon the rocky places, where they had not much earth: and straightway they sprang up, because they had no deepness of earth: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and when the sun was risen, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And others fell upon the thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and others fell upon the good ground, and yielded fruit, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He that hath ears, let him hear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou unto them in parables? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he answered and said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Therefore speak I to them in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And unto them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith,
<br>
By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand;
<br>
And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For this people’s heart is waxed gross,
<br>
And their ears are dull of hearing,
<br>
And their eyes they have closed;
<br>
Lest haply they should perceive with their eyes,
<br>
And hear with their ears,
<br>
And understand with their heart,
<br>
And should turn again,
<br>
And I should heal them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For verily I say unto you, that many prophets and righteous men desired to see the things which ye see, and saw them not; and to hear the things which ye hear, and heard them not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Hear then ye the parable of the sower.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the evil one, and snatcheth away that which hath been sown in his heart.
<br>
 This is he that was sown by the way side.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he that was sown upon the rocky places, this is he that heareth the word, and straightway with joy receiveth it; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> yet hath he not root in himself, but endureth for a while; and when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, straightway he stumbleth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And he that was sown among the thorns, this is he that heareth the word; and the care of the world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he that was sown upon the good ground, this is he that heareth the word, and understandeth it; who verily beareth fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man that sowed good seed in his field: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares also among the wheat, and went away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> But when the blade sprang up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath it tares? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And he said unto them, An enemy hath done this.
<br>
 And the servants say unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> But he saith, Nay; lest haply while ye gather up the tares, ye root up the wheat with them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather up first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> which indeed is less than all seeds; but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and lodge in the branches thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Another parable spoke he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till it was all leavened.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> All these things spoke [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]in parables unto the multitudes; and without a parable spoke he nothing unto them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through the prophet, saying,
<br>
I will open my mouth in parables;
<br>
I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Then he left the multitudes, and went into the house: and his disciples came unto him, saying, Explain unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And he answered and said, He that soweth the good seed is the Bar Enosh; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> and the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> and the enemy that sowed them is the devil: and the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are angels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> As therefore the tares are gathered up and burned with fire; so shall it be in the end of the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> The Bar Enosh shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and them that do iniquity, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.
<br>
 He that hath ears, let him hear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> The kingdom of heaven is like unto a treasure hidden in the field; which a man found, and hid; and in his joy he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a merchant seeking goodly pearls: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> and having found one pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> which, when it was filled, they drew up on the beach; and they sat down, and gathered the good into vessels, but the bad they cast away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> So shall it be in the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the righteous, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> and shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> Have ye understood all these things? They say unto him, Yea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who hath been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> And it came to pass, when [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]had finished these parables, he departed thence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> And coming into his own country he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Maryam? and his brethren, James, and Yosef, and Simon, and Judas? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> And they were offended in him.
<br>
 But [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in his own house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">58</sup> And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
