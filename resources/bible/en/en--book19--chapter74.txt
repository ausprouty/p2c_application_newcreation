<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(Maschil of Asaph) O Elokim, why hast thou cast us off for ever?
<br>
Why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Remember thy congregation, which thou hast gotten [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41; He is here called our Purchaser and this means we can dare to call the Atik Yomin Father because although salvation is of the Jews (John 4:12 ) he chose us also (Ephesians 1:5) for the adoption (Romans 9:4) and purchased and redeemed us through the Lamb of our Exodus and we see his fatherhood in Isaiah 63:16 and Malachi 2:10] of old, Which thou hast redeemed to be the tribe of thine inheritance; And mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual ruins,
<br>
All the evil that the enemy hath done in the sanctuary.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thine adversaries have roared in the midst of thine assembly;
<br>
They have set up their ensigns for signs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They seemed as men that lifted up
<br>
Axes upon a thicket of trees.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And now all the carved work thereof
<br>
They break down with hatchet and hammers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> They have set thy sanctuary on fire;
<br>
They have profaned the dwelling-place of thy name by casting it to the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether:
<br>
They have burned up all the synagogues of Elokim in the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> We see not our signs:
<br>
There is no more any prophet;
<br>
Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> How long, O Elokim, shall the adversary reproach?
<br>
Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand?
<br>
Pluck it out of thy bosom and consume them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Yet Elokim is my King of old,
<br>
Working salvation in the midst of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength:
<br>
Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces;
<br>
Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thou didst cleave fountain and flood:
<br>
Thou driedst up mighty rivers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The day is thine, the night also is thine:
<br>
Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Thou hast set all the borders of the earth:
<br>
Thou hast made summer and winter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Oh deliver not the soul of thy turtle-dove unto the wild beast:
<br>
Forget not the life of thy poor for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Have respect unto the covenant;
<br>
For the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Oh let not the oppressed return ashamed:
<br>
Let the poor and needy praise thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Arise, O Elokim, plead thine own cause:
<br>
Remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee all the day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Forget not the voice of thine adversaries:
<br>
The tumult of those that rise up against thee ascendeth continually.
