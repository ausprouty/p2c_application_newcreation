<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations; spare not: lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth; and the reproach of thy widowhood shalt thou remember no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For thy Maker is thy husband; تتراجراماتون of hosts is his name: and the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer; the Elokim of the whole earth shall he be called.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For تتراجراماتون hath called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off, saith thy Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting lovingkindness will I have mercy on thee, saith تتراجراماتون thy Redeemer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For this is as the waters of Noah unto me; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I will not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed; but my lovingkindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith تتراجراماتون that hath mercy on thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And all thy children shall be taught of تتراجراماتون; and great shall be the peace of thy children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Behold, they may gather together, but not by me: whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the fire of coals, and bringeth forth a weapon for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn.
<br>
 This is the heritage of the servants of تتراجراماتون, and their righteousness which is of me, saith تتراجراماتون.
