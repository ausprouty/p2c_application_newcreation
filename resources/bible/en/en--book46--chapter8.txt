<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge.
<br>
 Knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> If any man thinketh that he knoweth anything, he knoweth not yet as he ought to know; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> but if any man loveth Elokim, the same is known by him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no Elokim but one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For though there be that are called Elokim, whether in heaven or on earth; as there are Elokim many, and lords many; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> yet to us there is one Elokim, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord, [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], through whom are all things, and we through him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Howbeit there is not in all men that knowledge: but some, being used until now to the idol, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But food will not commend us to Elokim: neither, if we eat not, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to the weak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For if a man see thee who hast knowledge sitting at meat in an idolâ€™s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For through thy knowledge he that is weak perisheth, the brother for whose sake al-Masih died.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And thus, sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, ye sin against al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Wherefore, if meat causeth my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I cause not my brother to stumble.
