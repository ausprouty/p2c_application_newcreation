<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> (For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and when they come from theMarketplace, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written,
<br>
This people honoreth me with their lips,
<br>
But their heart is far from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But in vain do they worship me,
<br>
Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Ye leave the commandment of Elokim, and hold fast the tradition of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of Elokim, that ye may keep your tradition.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For Musa said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given to Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> making void the word of Elokim by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> He who has ears to hear let him hear. 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? This he said, making all meats clean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon.
<br>
 And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race.
<br>
 And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.
