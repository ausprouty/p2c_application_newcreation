<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Again, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Son of man, write thee the name of the day, even of this selfsame day: the king of Babylon drew close unto Jerusalem this selfsame day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And utter a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون, Set on the caldron, set it on, and also pour water into it: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Take the choice of the flock, and also a pile of wood for the bones under the caldron; make it boil well; yea, let the bones thereof be boiled in the midst of it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Wherefore thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: Woe to the bloody city, to the caldron whose rust is therein, and whose rust is not gone out of it! take out of it piece after piece; No lot is fallen upon it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the bare rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> That it may cause wrath to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the bare rock, that it should not be covered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Therefore thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: Woe to the bloody city! I also will make the pile great.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Heap on the wood, make the fire hot, boil well the flesh, and make thick the broth, and let the bones be burned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the rust of it may be consumed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> She hath wearied herself with toil; yet her great rust goeth not forth out of her; her rust goeth not forth by fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> In thy filthiness is lewdness: because I have cleansed thee and thou wast not cleansed, thou shalt not be cleansed from thy filthiness any more, till I have caused my wrath toward thee to rest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I, تتراجراماتون, have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, shall they judge thee, saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Also the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke: yet thou shalt neither mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Sigh, but not aloud, make no mourning for the dead; bind thy headtire upon thee, and put thy shoes upon thy feet, and cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> So I spoke unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Then I said unto them, The word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your power, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pitieth; and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left behind shall fall by the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And your tires shall be upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and moan one toward another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Thus shallEzekiel be unto you a sign; according to all that he hath done shall ye do: when this cometh, then shall ye know that I am HaAdon تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And thou, son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their heart, their sons and their daughters, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> that in that day he that escapeth shall come unto thee, to cause thee to hear it with thine ears? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him that is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb: so shalt thou be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am تتراجراماتون.
