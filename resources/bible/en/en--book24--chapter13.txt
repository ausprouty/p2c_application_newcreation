<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون unto me, Go, and buy [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> So I bought a girdle according to the word of تتراجراماتون, and put it upon my loins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me the second time, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a cleft of the rock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> So I went, and hid it by the Euphrates, as تتراجراماتون commanded me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And it came to pass after many days, that تتراجراماتون said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Then I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Then the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> This evil people, that refuse to hear my words, that walk in the stubbornness of their heart, and are gone after other Elokim to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is profitable for nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith تتراجراماتون; that they may be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David’s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith تتراجراماتون: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have compassion, that I should not destroy them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud; for تتراجراماتون hath spoken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Give glory to تتراجراماتون your Elokim, before he cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and, while ye look for light, he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret for your pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run down with tears, because تتراجراماتون’s flock is taken captive.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Say thou unto the king and to the queen-mother, Humble yourselves, sit down; for your headtires are come down, even the crown of your glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The cities of the South are shut up, and there is none to open them: Judah is carried away captive, all of it; it is wholly carried away captive.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> What wilt thou say, when he shall set over thee as head those whom thou hast thyself taught to be friends to thee? shall not sorrows take hold of thee, as of a woman in travail? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore are these things come upon me? for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels suffer violence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Therefore will I scatter them, as the stubble that passeth away, by the wind of the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> This is thy lot, the portion measured unto thee from me, saith تتراجراماتون; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Therefore will I also uncover thy skirts upon thy face, and thy shame shall appear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> I have seen thine abominations, even thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom, on the hills in the field. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! thou wilt not be made clean; how long shall it yet be?
