<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], to them that have obtained a like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our Elokim and the Saviour [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Grace to you and peace be multiplied in the knowledge of Elokim and of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]our Lord; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> seeing that his divine power hath granted unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that called us by his own glory and virtue; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> whereby he hath granted unto us his precious and exceeding great promises; that through these ye may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world by lust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Yea, and for this very cause adding on your part all diligence, in your faith supply virtue; and in your virtue knowledge; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and in your knowledge self-control; and in your self-control patience; and in your patience godliness; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and in your godliness brotherly kindness; and in your brotherly kindness love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For if these things are yours and abound, they make you to be not idle nor unfruitful unto the knowledge of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For he that lacketh these things is blind, seeing only what is near, having forgotten the cleansing from his old sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Wherefore, brethren, give the more diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never stumble: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> for thus shall be richly supplied unto you the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Wherefore I shall be ready always to put you in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and are established in the truth which is with you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And I think it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle cometh swiftly, even as our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] signified unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Yea, I will give diligence that at every time ye may be able after my decease to call these things to remembrance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For we did not follow cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For he received from Elokim the Father honor and glory, when there was borne such a voice to him by the Majestic Glory, This is my beloved Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], in whom I am well pleased: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and this voice we ourselves heard borne out of heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And we have the word of prophecy made more sure; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-star arise in your hearts: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> knowing this first, that no prophecy of scripture is of private interpretation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For no prophecy ever came by the will of man: but men spoke from Elokim, being moved by the Holy Ruach [T.N. This reminds us that authoritative Scripture is to be followed and we are not to go beyond what is written (I Corinthians 4:6), and we are not to take our stand based on what so-called great teachers, as in the Corinthian divisive atmosphere, might ruminate on.]
