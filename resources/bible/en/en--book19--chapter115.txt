<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Not unto us, O تتراجراماتون, not unto us,
<br>
But unto thy name give glory,
<br>
For thy lovingkindness, and for thy truth’s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Wherefore should the nations say,
<br>
Where is now their Elokim?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But our Elokim is in the heavens:
<br>
He hath done whatsoever he pleased.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Their idols are silver and gold,
<br>
The work of men’s hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They have mouths, but they speak not;
<br>
Eyes have they, but they see not;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> They have ears, but they hear not;
<br>
Noses have they, but they smell not;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> They have hands, but they handle not;
<br>
Feet have they, but they walk not;
<br>
Neither speak they through their throat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> They that make them shall be like unto them;
<br>
Yea, every one that trusteth in them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> O Israel, trust thou in تتراجراماتون:
<br>
He is their help and their shield.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> O house of Haron (Aaron), trust ye in تتراجراماتون:
<br>
He is their help and their shield.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Ye that fear تتراجراماتون, trust in تتراجراماتون:
<br>
He is their help and their shield.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> تتراجراماتون hath been mindful of us; he will bless us:
<br>
He will bless the house of Israel;
<br>
He will bless the house of Haron (Aaron).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He will bless them that fear تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Both small and great.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> تتراجراماتون increase you more and more,
<br>
You and your children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Blessed are ye of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Who made heaven and earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The heavens are the heavens of تتراجراماتون;
<br>
But the earth hath he given to the children of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The dead praise not تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Neither any that go down into silence;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But we will bless تتراجراماتون
<br>
From this time forth and for evermore.
<br>
Praise ye تتراجراماتون.
