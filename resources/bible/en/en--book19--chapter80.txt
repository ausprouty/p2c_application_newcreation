<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician, set to Shoshanim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph) Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel,
<br>
Thou that leadest Yusuf (Joseph) like a flock;
<br>
Thou that sittest above the cherubim, shine forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up thy might,
<br>
And come to save us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Turn us again, O Elokim;
<br>
And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> O تتراجراماتون Elokim of hosts,
<br>
How long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears,
<br>
And given them tears to drink in large measure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors;
<br>
And our enemies laugh among themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Turn us again, O Elokim of hosts;
<br>
And cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt:
<br>
Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thou preparedst room before it,
<br>
And it took deep root, and filled the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The mountains were covered with the shadow of it,
<br>
And the boughs thereof were like cedars of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> It sent out its branches unto the sea,
<br>
And its shoots unto the River.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Why hast thou broken down its walls,
<br>
So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The boar out of the wood doth ravage it,
<br>
And the wild beasts of the field feed on it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Turn again, we beseech thee, O Elokim of hosts:
<br>
Look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And the stock which thy right hand planted,
<br>
And the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> It is burned with fire, it is cut down:
<br>
They perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand,
<br>
Upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> So shall we not go back from thee:
<br>
Quicken thou us, and we will call upon thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Turn us again, O تتراجراماتون Elokim of hosts;
<br>
Cause thy face to shine, and we shall be saved.
