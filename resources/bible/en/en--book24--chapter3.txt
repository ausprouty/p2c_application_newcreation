<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, will he return unto her again? will not that land be greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Lift up thine eyes unto the bare heights, and see; where hast thou not been lain with? By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; yet thou hadst a harlot’s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My Father, thou art the guide of my youth? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Will he retain his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil things, and hast had thy way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Moreover تتراجراماتون said unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And I said after she had done all these things, She will return unto me; but she returned not: and her treacherous sister Judah saw it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And I saw, when, for this very cause that backsliding Israel had committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement, yet treacherous Judah her sister feared not; but she also went and played the harlot.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that the land was polluted, and she committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath showed herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith تتراجراماتون; I will not look in anger upon you; for I am merciful, saith تتراجراماتون, I will not keep anger for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Return, O backsliding children, saith تتراجراماتون; for I am a husband unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And I will give you shepherds according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith تتراجراماتون, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون; neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember it; neither shall they miss it; neither shall it be made any more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of تتراجراماتون; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of تتراجراماتون, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the stubbornness of their evil heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I gave for an inheritance unto your fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But I said, How I will put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of the nations! and I said, Ye shall call me My Father, and shall not turn away from following me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> A voice is heard upon the bare heights, the weeping and the supplications of the children of Israel; because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten تتراجراماتون their Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Return, ye backsliding children, I will heal your backslidings.
<br>
Behold, we are come unto thee; for thou art تتراجراماتون our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Truly in vain is the help that is looked for from the hills, the tumult on the mountains: truly in تتراجراماتون our Elokim is the salvation of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But the shameful thing hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Let us lie down in our shame, and let our confusion cover us; for we have sinned against تتراجراماتون our Elokim, we and our fathers, from our youth even unto this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of تتراجراماتون our Elokim.
