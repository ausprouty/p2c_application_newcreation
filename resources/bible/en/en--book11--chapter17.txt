<sup class="versenum">1</sup>And IIyas (Elijah) the Tishbite, who was of the sojourners of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, liveth, before whom I stand, there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the word of تتراجراماتون came unto him, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Get thee hence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> So he went and did according unto the word of تتراجراماتون; for he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the word of تتراجراماتون came unto him, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Arise, get thee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Sidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow there to sustain thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> So he arose and went to Zarephath; and when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks: and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And she said, As تتراجراماتون thy Elokim liveth, I have not a cake, but a handful of meal in the jar, and a little oil in the cruse: and, behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And IIyas (Elijah) said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it forth unto me, and afterward make for thee and for thy son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, The jar of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that تتراجراماتون sendeth rain upon the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And she went and did according to the saying of IIyas (Elijah): and she, and he, and her house, did eat many days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The jar of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of تتراجراماتون, which he spoke by IIyas (Elijah).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And she said unto IIyas (Elijah), What have I to do with thee, O thou man of Elokim? thou art come unto me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to slay my son! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he said unto her, Give me thy son.
<br>
 And he took him out of her bosom, and carried him up into the chamber, where he abode, and laid him upon his own bed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And he cried unto تتراجراماتون, and said, O تتراجراماتون my Elokim, hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he stretched himself upon the child three times, and cried unto تتراجراماتون, and said, O تتراجراماتون my Elokim, I pray thee, let this child’s soul come into him again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And تتراجراماتون hearkened unto the voice of IIyas (Elijah); and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And IIyas (Elijah) took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother; and IIyas (Elijah) said, See, thy son liveth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And the woman said to IIyas (Elijah), Now I know that thou art a man of Elokim, and that the word of تتراجراماتون in thy mouth is truth.
