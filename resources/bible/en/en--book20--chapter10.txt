<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The proverbs of Solomon.
<br>
A wise son maketh a glad father;
<br>
But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Treasures of wickedness profit nothing;
<br>
But righteousness delivereth from death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> تتراجراماتون will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish;
<br>
But he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He becometh poor that worketh with a slack hand;
<br>
But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> He that gathereth in summer is a wise son;
<br>
But he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Blessings are upon the head of the righteous;
<br>
But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The memory of the righteous is blessed;
<br>
But the name of the wicked shall rot.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The wise in heart will receive commandments;
<br>
But a prating fool shall fall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He that walketh uprightly walketh surely;
<br>
But he that perverteth his ways shall be known.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow;
<br>
But a prating fool shall fall.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life;
<br>
But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Hatred stirreth up strifes;
<br>
But love covereth all transgressions.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found;
<br>
But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Wise men lay up knowledge;
<br>
But the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The rich man’s wealth is his strong city:
<br>
The destruction of the poor is their poverty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The labor of the righteous tendeth to life;
<br>
The increase of the wicked, to sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He is in the way of life that heedeth correction;
<br>
But he that forsaketh reproof erreth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He that hideth hatred is of lying lips;
<br>
And he that uttereth a slander is a fool.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression;
<br>
But he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver:
<br>
The heart of the wicked is little worth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The lips of the righteous feed many;
<br>
But the foolish die for lack of understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The blessing of تتراجراماتون, it maketh rich;
<br>
And he addeth no sorrow therewith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness;
<br>
And so is wisdom to a man of understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him;
<br>
And the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more;
<br>
But the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes,
<br>
So is the sluggard to them that send him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> The fear of تتراجراماتون prolongeth days;
<br>
But the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> The hope of the righteous shall be gladness;
<br>
But the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> The way of تتراجراماتون is a stronghold to the upright;
<br>
But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> The righteous shall never be removed;
<br>
But the wicked shall not dwell in the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom;
<br>
But the perverse tongue shall be cut off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable;
<br>
But the mouth of the wicked speaketh perverseness.
