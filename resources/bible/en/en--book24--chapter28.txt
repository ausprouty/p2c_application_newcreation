<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke unto me in the house of تتراجراماتون, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thus speaketh تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of تتراجراماتون’s house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went to Babylon, saith تتراجراماتون; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of تتراجراماتون, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: تتراجراماتون do so; تتراجراماتون perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of تتراجراماتون’s house, and all them of the captivity, from Babylon unto this place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that تتراجراماتون hath truly sent him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Then Hananiah the prophet took the bar from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck, and brake it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith تتراجراماتون: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon within two full years from off the neck of all the nations.
<br>
 And the prophet Jeremiah went his way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Then the word of تتراجراماتون came unto Jeremiah, after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the bar from off the neck of the prophetJeremiah, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Go, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith تتراجراماتون: Thou hast broken the bars of wood; but thou hast made in their stead bars of iron.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel: I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah: تتراجراماتون hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Therefore thus saith تتراجراماتون, Behold, I will send thee away from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast spoken rebellion against تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
