<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, a servant of Elokim, and an apostle of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], according to the faith of Elokim’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> in hope of eternal life, which Elokim, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of Elokim our Saviour; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from Elokim the Father and [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]our Saviour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For the bishop must be blameless, as Elokim’s steward; not self-willed, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober-minded, just, holy, self-controlled; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said,
<br>
Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> This testimony is true.
<br>
 For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith, 
<br>
[T.N. So with this New Creation Muslim Bible translation we quote a true saying of "one of their prophets," and let the Inerrant Bible make a strong "rebuke, that they may be sound in the faith" as a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .]
<br>

<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> They profess that they know Elokim; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
