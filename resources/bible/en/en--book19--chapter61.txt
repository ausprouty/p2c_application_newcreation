<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; on a stringed instrument. A Psalm of Dawad) Hear my cry, O Elokim;
<br>
Attend unto my prayer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> From the end of the earth will I call unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed:
<br>
Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For thou hast been a refuge for me,
<br>
A strong tower from the enemy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever:
<br>
I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For thou, O Elokim, hast heard my vows:
<br>
Thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thou wilt prolong the kingâ€™s life;
<br>
His years shall be as many generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He shall abide before Elokim for ever:
<br>
Oh prepare lovingkindness and truth, that they may preserve him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever,
<br>
That I may daily perform my vows.
