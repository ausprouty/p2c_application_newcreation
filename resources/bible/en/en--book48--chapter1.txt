<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], and Elokim the Father [T.N. See Daniel 7:13-14; Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41. John 1:18 says of (Prophet) Isa al-Masih (pbuh), No man hath seen Elokim at any time; the only begotten (Bar Enosh) Son, who is in the bosom of the (Atik Yomin) Father (Daniel 7:13-14), he hath declared him.], who raised him from the dead),
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and all the brethren that are with me, unto the New Creation Masjid of Galatia: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Grace to you and peace from Elokim the Father, and our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our Elokim and Father: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> to whom be the glory for ever and ever.
<br>
 Amen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Al-Masih unto a different Holy Injil; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> which is not another Holy Injil: only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the Holy Injil of al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any Holy Injil other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any Holy Injil other than that which ye received, let him be anathema [T.N. The Holy Injil is being distorted and perverted in Galatia. Adding conditions to salvation which affect the doctrine of justification is a serious error. No other foundation can be laid other than the foundation of Isaiah 53:11 which says of al-Masih, He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of him (see John 14:9) shall my righteous servant justify many (see Romans 5:1; Genesis 15:6; Habakkuk 2:4. Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:28; Galatians 3:24. No al-Salaam peace with تتراجراماتون without faith in Masih and depending on him alone to be put right with تتراجراماتون; and, yes, true faith is active in love, Galatians 5:6; James 2:14, 17, 20, 26; Ephesians 2:10). We see from Exodus 12:13 the token in that verse that points to Isaiah 53:7 and John 14:6 and constitutes the token of justification (Romans 5:9) and admission to heaven].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of Elokim? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the Holy Injil which was preached by me, that it is not after man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the New Creation Masjid of Elokim, and made havoc of it: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But when it was the good pleasure of Elokim, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> to reveal his Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)] in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But other of the apostles saw I none, save James Achi Adoneinu.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before Elokim, I lie not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And I was still unknown by face unto the New Creation Masjid of Judaea which were in Al-Masih: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and they glorified Elokim in me.
