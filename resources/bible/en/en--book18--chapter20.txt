<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me,
<br>
Even by reason of my haste that is in me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame;
<br>
And the spirit of my understanding answereth me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Knowest thou not this of old time,
<br>
Since man was placed upon earth,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> That the triumphing of the wicked is short,
<br>
And the joy of the Godless but for a moment?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Though his height mount up to the heavens,
<br>
And his head reach unto the clouds;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung:
<br>
They that have seen him shall say, Where is he?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found:
<br>
Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The eye which saw him shall see him no more;
<br>
Neither shall his place any more behold him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> His children shall seek the favor of the poor,
<br>
And his hands shall give back his wealth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> His bones are full of his youth,
<br>
But it shall lie down with him in the dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth,
<br>
Though he hide it under his tongue,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Though he spare it, and will not let it go,
<br>
But keep it still within his mouth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Yet his food in his bowels is turned,
<br>
It is the gall of asps within him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again;
<br>
Elokim will cast them out of his belly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> He shall suck the poison of asps:
<br>
The viperâ€™s tongue shall slay him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He shall not look upon the rivers,
<br>
The flowing streams of honey and butter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down;
<br>
According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor;
<br>
He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Because he knew no quietness within him,
<br>
He shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> There was nothing left that he devoured not;
<br>
Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
<br>
The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> When he is about to fill his belly, Elokim will cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him,
<br>
And will rain it upon him while he is eating.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> He shall flee from the iron weapon,
<br>
And the bow of brass shall strike him through.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body;
<br>
Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall:
<br>
Terrors are upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> All darkness is laid up for his treasures:
<br>
A fire not blown by man shall devour him;
<br>
It shall consume that which is left in his tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> The heavens shall reveal his iniquity,
<br>
And the earth shall rise up against him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> The increase of his house shall depart;
<br>
His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> This is the portion of a wicked man from Elokim,
<br>
And the heritage appointed unto him by Elokim.
