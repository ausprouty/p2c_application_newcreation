<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of Dawad) In تتراجراماتون do I take refuge:
<br>
How say ye to my soul,
<br>
Flee as a bird to your mountain;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For, lo, the wicked bend the bow,
<br>
They make ready their arrow upon the string,
<br>
That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> If the foundations be destroyed,
<br>
What can the righteous do?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> تتراجراماتون is in his holy temple;
<br>
تتراجراماتون, his throne is in heaven;
<br>
His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> تتراجراماتون trieth the righteous;
<br>
But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Upon the wicked he will rain snares;
<br>
Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For تتراجراماتون is righteous; he loveth righteousness:
<br>
The upright shall behold his face.
