<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Song of Ascents; of Dawad) If it had not been تتراجراماتون who was on our side,

Let Israel now say,

<sup class="versenum">2</sup> If it had not been تتراجراماتون who was on our side,
<br>
When men rose up against us;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Then they had swallowed us up alive,
<br>
When their wrath was kindled against us:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Then the waters had overwhelmed us,
<br>
The stream had gone over our soul;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Blessed be تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
<br>
The snare is broken, and we are escaped.

<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Our help is in the name of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Who made heaven and earth.
