<sup class="versenum">1</sup> By the rivers of Babylon,
<br>
There we sat down, yea, we wept,
<br>
When we remembered Zion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Upon the willows in the midst thereof
<br>
We hanged up our harps.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For there they that led us captive required of us songs,
<br>
And they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,
<br>
Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> How shall we sing تتراجراماتون’s song
<br>
In a foreign land?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> If I forget thee, O Jerusalem,
<br>
Let my right hand forget her skill.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,
<br>
If I remember thee not;
<br>
If I prefer not Jerusalem
<br>
Above my chief joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Remember, O تتراجراماتون, against the children of Edom
<br>
The day of Jerusalem;
<br>
Who said, Rase it, rase it,
<br>
Even to the foundation thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> O daughter of Babylon, that art to be destroyed,
<br>
Happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee
<br>
As thou hast served us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
<br>
Against the rock.
