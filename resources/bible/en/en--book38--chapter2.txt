<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For I, saith تتراجراماتون, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith تتراجراماتون; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which plundered you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them; and ye shall know that تتراجراماتون of hosts hath sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And many nations shall join themselves to تتراجراماتون in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that تتراجراماتون of hosts hath sent me unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And تتراجراماتون shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Be silent, all flesh, before تتراجراماتون; for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.
