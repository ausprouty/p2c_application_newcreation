<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician. Maschil of Dawad; when Doeg the Edomite came and told Saul, and said unto him, Dawad is come to the house of Ahimelech) Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man?
<br>
The lovingkindness of Elokim endureth continually.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thy tongue deviseth very wickedness,
<br>
Like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou lovest evil more than good,
<br>
And lying rather than to speak righteousness.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thou lovest all devouring words,
<br>
O thou deceitful tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Elokim will likewise destroy thee for ever;
<br>
He will take thee up, and pluck thee out of thy tent,
<br>
And root thee out of the land of the living.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The righteous also shall see it, and fear,
<br>
And shall laugh at him, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Lo, this is the man that made not Elokim his strength,
<br>
But trusted in the abundance of his riches,
<br>
And strengthened himself in his wickedness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But as for me, I am like a green olive-tree in the house of Elokim:
<br>
I trust in the lovingkindness of Elokim for ever and ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I will give thee thanks for ever, because thou hast done it;
<br>
And I will hope in thy name, for it is good, in the presence of thy saints.
