<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Song of Ascents) Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up,
<br>
Let Israel now say,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up:
<br>
Yet they have not prevailed against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The plowers plowed upon my back;
<br>
They made long their furrows.

<sup class="versenum">4</sup> تتراجراماتون is righteous:
<br>
He hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Let them be put to shame and turned backward,
<br>
All they that hate Zion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Let them be as the grass upon the housetops,
<br>
Which withereth before it groweth up;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Wherewith the reaper filleth not his hand,
<br>
Nor he that bindeth sheaves, his bosom:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Neither do they that go by say,
<br>
The blessing of تتراجراماتون be upon you;
<br>
We bless you in the name of تتراجراماتون.
