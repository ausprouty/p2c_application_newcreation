<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And they covet fields, and seize them; and houses, and take them away: and they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Therefore thus saith تتراجراماتون: Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks, neither shall ye walk haughtily; for it is an evil time.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> In that day shall they take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We are utterly ruined: he changeth the portion of my people: how doth he remove it from me! to the rebellious he divideth our fields.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast the line by lot in the assembly of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Prophesy ye not, thus they prophesy.
<br>
 They shall not prophesy to these: reproaches shall not depart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Shall it be said, O house of Ya’qub (Jacob), Is the Spirit of تتراجراماتون straitened? are these his doings? Do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye strip the robe from off the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The women of my people ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their young children ye take away my glory for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your resting-place; because of uncleanness that destroyeth, even with a grievous destruction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> If a man walking in a spirit of falsehood do lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I will surely assemble, O Ya’qub (Jacob), all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as a flock in the midst of their pasture; they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The breaker is gone up before them: they have broken forth and passed on to the gate, and are gone out thereat; and their king is passed on before them, and تتراجراماتون at the head of them.
