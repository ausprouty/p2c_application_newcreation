<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of تتراجراماتون, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes’ 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father go unto the same maiden, to profane my holy name: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their Elokim they drink the wine of such as have been fined.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites.
<br>
 Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Behold, I will press you in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And flight shall perish from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself; neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith تتراجراماتون.
