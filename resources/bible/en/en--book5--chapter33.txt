<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And this is the blessing, wherewith Musa the man of Elokim blessed the children of Israel before his death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he said,
<br>
تتراجراماتون came from Sinai,
<br>
And rose from Seir unto them;
<br>
He shined forth from mount Paran,
<br>
And he came from the ten thousands of holy ones:
<br>
At his right hand was a fiery law for them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Yea, he loveth the people;
<br>
All his saints are in thy hand:
<br>
And they sat down at thy feet;
<br>
Every one shall receive of thy words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Musa commanded us a law,
<br>
An inheritance for the assembly of Ya’qub (Jacob).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he was king in Jeshurun,
<br>
When the heads of the people were gathered,
<br>
All the tribes of Israel together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Let Reuben live, and not die;
<br>
Nor let his men be few.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said,
<br>
Hear, تتراجراماتون, the voice of Judah,
<br>
And bring him in unto his people.
<br>
With his hands he contended for himself;
<br>
And thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And of Levi he said,
<br>
Thy Thummim and thy Urim are with thy Godly one,
<br>
Whom thou didst prove at Massah,
<br>
With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;
<br>
Neither did he acknowledge his brethren,
<br>
Nor knew he his own children:
<br>
For they have observed thy word,
<br>
And keep thy covenant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> They shall teach Ya’qub (Jacob) thine ordinances,
<br>
And Israel thy law:
<br>
They shall put incense before thee,
<br>
And whole burnt-offering upon thine altar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Bless, تتراجراماتون, his substance,
<br>
And accept the work of his hands:
<br>
Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him,
<br>
And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Of Benjamin he said,
<br>
The beloved of تتراجراماتون shall dwell in safety by him;
<br>
He covereth him all the day long,
<br>
And he dwelleth between his shoulders.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And of Yusuf (Joseph) he said,
<br>
Blessed of تتراجراماتون be his land,
<br>
For the precious things of heaven, for the dew,
<br>
And for the deep that coucheth beneath,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun,
<br>
And for the precious things of the growth of the moons,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And for the chief things of the ancient mountains,
<br>
And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof,
<br>
And the good will of him that dwelt in the bush.
<br>
Let the blessing come upon the head of Yusuf (Joseph),
<br>
And upon the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The firstling of his herd, majesty is his;
<br>
And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox:
<br>
With them he shall push the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth:
<br>
And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
<br>
And they are the thousands of Manasseh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And of Zebulun he said,
<br>
Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
<br>
And, Issachar, in thy tents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> They shall call the peoples unto the mountain;
<br>
There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness:
<br>
For they shall suck the abundance of the seas,
<br>
And the hidden treasures of the sand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And of Gad he said,
<br>
Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad:
<br>
He dwelleth as a lioness,
<br>
And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And he provided the first part for himself,
<br>
For there was the lawgiver’s portion reserved;
<br>
And he came with the heads of the people;
<br>
He executed the righteousness of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And his ordinances with Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And of Dan he said,
<br>
Dan is a lion’s whelp,
<br>
That leapeth forth from Bashan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And of Naphtali he said,
<br>
O Naphtali, satisfied with favor,
<br>
And full with the blessing of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Possess thou the west and the south.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And of Asher he said,
<br>
Blessed be Asher with children;
<br>
Let him be acceptable unto his brethren,
<br>
And let him dip his foot in oil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Thy bars shall be iron and brass;
<br>
And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> There is none like unto Elokim, O Jeshurun,
<br>
Who rideth upon the heavens for thy help,
<br>
And in his excellency on the skies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> The eternal Elokim is thy dwelling-place,
<br>
And underneath are the everlasting arms.
<br>
And he thrust out the enemy from before thee,
<br>
And said, Destroy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Israel dwelleth in safety,
<br>
The fountain of Ya’qub (Jacob) alone,
<br>
In a land of grain and new wine;
<br>
Yea, his heavens drop down dew.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Happy art thou, O Israel:
<br>
Who is like unto thee, a people saved by تتراجراماتون,
<br>
The shield of thy help,
<br>
And the sword of thy excellency!
<br>
And thine enemies shall submit themselves unto thee;
<br>
And thou shalt tread upon their high places.
