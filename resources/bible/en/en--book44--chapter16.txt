<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he came also to Derbe and to Lystra: and behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewess that believed; but his father was a Greek.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The same was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those parts: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And as they went on their way through the cities, they delivered them the decrees to keep which had been ordained of the apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> So the New Creation Masjid were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden of the Holy Ruach to speak the word in Asia; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and when they were come over against Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia; and the Spirit of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]suffered them not; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a man of Macedonia standing, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And when he had seen the vision, straightway we sought to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that Elokim had called us to preach the Holy Injil unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Setting sail therefore from Troas, we made a straight course to Samothrace, and the day following to Neapolis; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and from thence to Philippi, which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district, a Roman colony: and we were in this city tarrying certain days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And on the sabbath day we went forth without the gate by a river side, where we supposed there was a place of prayer; and we sat down, and spoke unto the women that were come together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, one that worshipped Elokim, heard us: whose heart HaAdon opened to give heed unto the things which were spoken by Paul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to HaAdon, come into my house, and abide there.
<br>
 And she constrained us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And it came to pass, as we were going to the place of prayer, that a certain maid having a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The same following after Paul and us cried out, saying, These men are servants of the Most High Elokim, who proclaim unto you the way of salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And this she did for many days.
<br>
 But Paul, being sore troubled, turned and said to the spirit, I charge thee in the name of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] to come out of her.
<br>
 And it came out that very hour.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> But when her masters saw that the hope of their gain was gone, they laid hold on Paul and Silas, and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and when they had brought them unto the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and set forth customs which it is not lawful for us to receive, or to observe, being Romans.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent their garments off them, and commanded to beat them with rods.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> who, having received such a charge, cast them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto Elokim, and the prisoners were listening to them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison-house were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened; and every oneâ€™s bands were loosed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And the jailor, being roused out of sleep and seeing the prison doors open, drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And he called for lights and sprang in, and, trembling for fear, fell down before Paul and Silas, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And they said, Believe on HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And they spoke the word of HaAdon unto him, with all that were in his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, immediately.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And he brought them up into his house, and set food before them, and rejoiced greatly, with all his house, having believed in Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> But when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And the jailor reported the words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore come forth, and go in peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men that are Romans, and have cast us into prison; and do they now cast us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and bring us out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And the serjeants reported these words unto the magistrates: and they feared when they heard that they were Romans; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> and they came and besought them; and when they had brought them out, they asked them to go away from the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
