<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (Michtam of Dawad) Preserve me, O Elokim; for in thee do I take refuge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> O my soul, thou hast said unto تتراجراماتون, Thou art my Lord:
<br>
I have no good beyond thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> As for the saints that are in the earth,
<br>
They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that give gifts for another Elokim:
<br>
Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer,
<br>
Nor take their names upon my lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> تتراجراماتون is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
<br>
Thou maintainest my lot.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places;
<br>
Yea, I have a goodly heritage.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I will bless تتراجراماتون, who hath given me counsel;
<br>
Yea, my heart instructeth me in the night seasons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I have set تتراجراماتون always before me:
<br>
Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth:
<br>
My flesh also shall dwell in safety.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For thou wilt not leave my soul to Sheol;
<br>
Neither wilt thou suffer thy holy one to see corruption [T.N. The body of al-Masih, in contrast to all other prophets, did not see corruption, showing the supreme revelation attested on the day of the Resurrection of al-Masih, Nisan 16, 3793].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Thou wilt show me the path of life: In thy presence is fulness of joy; In thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
