<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?
<br>
Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?
<br>
Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> They bow themselves, they bring forth their young,
<br>
They cast out their pains.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field;
<br>
They go forth, and return not again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Who hath sent out the wild ass free?
<br>
Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Whose home I have made the wilderness,
<br>
And the salt land his dwelling-place?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He scorneth the tumult of the city,
<br>
Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The range of the mountains is his pasture,
<br>
And he searcheth after every green thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee?
<br>
Or will he abide by thy crib?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow?
<br>
Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?
<br>
Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed,
<br>
And gather the grain of thy threshing-floor?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The wings of the ostrich wave proudly;
<br>
But are they the pinions and plumage of love?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For she leaveth her eggs on the earth,
<br>
And warmeth them in the dust,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And forgetteth that the foot may crush them,
<br>
Or that the wild beast may trample them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers:
<br>
Though her labor be in vain, she is without fear;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Because Elokim hath deprived her of wisdom,
<br>
Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> What time she lifteth up herself on high,
<br>
She scorneth the horse and his rider.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Hast thou given the horse his might?
<br>
Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Hast thou made him to leap as a locust?
<br>
The glory of his snorting is terrible.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength:
<br>
He goeth out to meet the armed men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed;
<br>
Neither turneth he back from the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The quiver rattleth against him,
<br>
The flashing spear and the javelin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage;
<br>
Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha!
<br>
And he smelleth the battle afar off,
<br>
The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth,
<br>
And stretcheth her wings toward the south?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up,
<br>
And maketh her nest on high?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home,
<br>
Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> From thence she spieth out the prey;
<br>
Her eyes behold it afar off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Her young ones also suck up blood:
<br>
And where the slain are, there is she.
