<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But his delight is in the law of تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And on his law doth he meditate day and night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither;
<br>
And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For تتراجراماتون knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.
