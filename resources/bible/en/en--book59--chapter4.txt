<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Whence come wars and whence come fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your pleasures that war in your members?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and covet, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war; ye have not, because ye ask not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may spend it in your pleasures.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Ye adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with Elokim? Whosoever therefore would be a friend of the world maketh himself an enemy of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Or think ye that the scripture speaketh in vain? Doth the spirit which he made to dwell in us long unto envying? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But he giveth more grace. Wherefore the scripture saith, Elokim resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Be subject therefore unto Elokim; but resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Draw nigh to Elokim, and he will draw nigh to you.
<br>
 Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye doubleminded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Humble yourselves in the sight of HaAdon, and he shall exalt you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Speak not one against another, brethren. He that speaketh against a brother, or judgeth his brother, speaketh against the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> One only is the lawgiver and judge, even he who is able to save and to destroy: but who art thou that judgest thy neighbor?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Come now, ye that say, To-day or to-morrow we will go into this city, and spend a year there, and trade, and get gain: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. What is your life? For ye are a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For that ye ought to say, If HaAdon will, we shall both live, and do this or that.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But now ye glory in your vauntings: all such glorying is evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> To him therefore that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
