<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left behind at Athens alone;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and sent Timothy, our brother and Elokimâ€™s minister in the Holy Injil of al-Masih, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> that no man be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For verily, when we were with you, we told you beforehand that we are to suffer affliction; even as it came to pass, and ye know.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For this cause I also, when I could no longer forbear, sent that I might know your faith, lest by any means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor should be in vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But when Timothy came even now unto us from you, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also to see you; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> for this cause, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our distress and affliction through your faith: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> for now we live, if ye stand fast in HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For what thanksgiving can we render again unto Elokim for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face, and may perfect that which is lacking in your faith?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now may our Elokim and Father himself, and our Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], direct our way unto you: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and HaAdon make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we also do toward you; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> to the end he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before our Elokim and Father, at the coming of our Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]with all his saints.
