<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Elokim spoke unto Musa, and said unto him, I am تتراجراماتون: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and I appeared unto Ibrahim (Abraham), unto Ishaq (Isaac), and unto Ya’qub (Jacob), as Elokim Almighty; but by my name تتراجراماتون I was not known to them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojournings, wherein they sojourned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage; and I have remembered my covenant.

<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Wherefore say unto the children of Israel, I am تتراجراماتون, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a Elokim; and ye shall know that I am تتراجراماتون your Elokim, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Go in, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Musa spoke before تتراجراماتون, saying, Behold, the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me; how then shall Pharaoh hear me, who am of uncircumcised lips?
