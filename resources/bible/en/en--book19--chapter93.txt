<sup class="versenum">1</sup> تتراجراماتون reigneth; he is clothed with majesty;
<br>
تتراجراماتون is clothed with strength; he hath girded himself therewith:
<br>
The world also is established, that it cannot be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thy throne is established of old:
<br>
Thou art from everlasting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The floods have lifted up, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
The floods have lifted up their voice;
<br>
The floods lift up their waves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Above the voices of many waters,
<br>
The mighty breakers of the sea,
<br>
تتراجراماتون on high is mighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thy testimonies are very sure:
<br>
Holiness becometh thy house,
<br>
O تتراجراماتون, for evermore.
