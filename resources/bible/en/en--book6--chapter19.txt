<sup class="versenum">48</sup> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance by the borders thereof; and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> according to the commandment of تتراجراماتون they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnath-serah in the hill-country of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot in Shiloh before تتراجراماتون, at the door of the tent of meeting.
<br>
 So they made an end of dividing the land.
