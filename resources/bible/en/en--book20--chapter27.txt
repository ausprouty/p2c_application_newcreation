<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Boast not thyself of tomorrow;
<br>
For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth;
<br>
A stranger, and not thine own lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty;
<br>
But a fool’s vexation is heavier than they both.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming;
<br>
But who is able to stand before jealousy?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Better is open rebuke
<br>
Than love that is hidden.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Faithful are the wounds of a friend;
<br>
But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The full soul loatheth a honeycomb;
<br>
But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> As a bird that wandereth from her nest,
<br>
So is a man that wandereth from his place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Oil and perfume rejoice the heart;
<br>
So doth the sweetness of a man’s friend that cometh of hearty counsel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not;
<br>
And go not to thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity:
<br>
Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> My son, be wise, and make my heart glad,
<br>
That I may answer him that reproacheth me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself;
<br>
But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Take his garment that is surety for a stranger;
<br>
And hold him in pledge that is surety for a foreign woman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning,
<br>
It shall be counted a curse to him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> A continual dropping in a very rainy day
<br>
And a contentious woman are alike:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> He that would restrain her restraineth the wind;
<br>
And his right hand encountereth oil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Iron sharpeneth iron;
<br>
So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof;
<br>
And he that regardeth his master shall be honored.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> As in water face answereth to face,
<br>
So the heart of man to man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied;
<br>
And the eyes of man are never satisfied.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
<br>
And a man is tried by his praise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain,
<br>
Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks,
<br>
And look well to thy herds:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> For riches are not for ever;
<br>
And doth the crown endure unto all generations?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> The hay is carried, and the tender grass showeth itself,
<br>
And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> The lambs are for thy clothing,
<br>
And the goats are the price of the field;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And there will be goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household,
<br>
And maintenance for thy maidens.
<br>
