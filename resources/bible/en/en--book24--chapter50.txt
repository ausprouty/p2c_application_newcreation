<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The word that تتراجراماتون spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> In those days, and in that time, saith تتراجراماتون, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek تتراجراماتون their Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come ye, and join yourselves to تتراجراماتون in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting-place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against تتراجراماتون, the habitation of righteousness, even تتراجراماتون, the hope of their fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Chaldea shall be a prey: all that prey upon her shall be satisfied, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder my heritage, because ye are wanton as a heifer that treadeth out the grain, and neigh as strong horses; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> your mother shall be utterly put to shame; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Because of the wrath of تتراجراماتون she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Shout against her round about: she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of تتراجراماتون: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Therefore thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> In those days, and in that time, saith تتراجراماتون, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith تتراجراماتون, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> تتراجراماتون hath opened his armory, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for HaAdon, تتراجراماتون of hosts, hath a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Come against her from the utmost border; open her store-houses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of تتراجراماتون our Elokim, the vengeance of his temple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; encamp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her; for she hath been proud against تتراجراماتون, against the Holy One of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith HaAdon, تتراجراماتون of hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all that took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Their Redeemer is strong; تتراجراماتون of hosts is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith تتراجراماتون, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad over idols.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> As when Elokim overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities thereof, saith تتراجراماتون, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> The king of Babylon hath heard the tidings of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that can stand before me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Therefore hear ye the counsel of تتراجراماتون, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.
