<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem; and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned, that she hath received of تتراجراماتون’s hand double for all her sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The voice of one that crieth, Prepare ye in the wilderness the way of تتراجراماتون; make level in the desert a highway for our Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the uneven shall be made level, and the rough places a plain: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and the glory of تتراجراماتون shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together; for the mouth of تتراجراماتون hath spoken it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The voice of one saying, Cry.
<br>
 And one said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the breath of تتراجراماتون bloweth upon it; surely the people is grass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The grass withereth, the flower fadeth; but the word of our Elokim shall stand forever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> O thou that tellest good tidings to Zion, get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that tellest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold, your Elokim! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Behold, HaAdon تتراجراماتون will come as a mighty one, and his arm will rule for him: Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He will feed his flock like a shepherd, he will gather the lambs in his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and will gently lead those that have their young.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Who hath directed the Spirit of تتراجراماتون, or being his counsellor hath taught him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of justice, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are accounted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> All the nations are as nothing before him; they are accounted by him as less than nothing, and vanity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> To whom then will ye liken Elokim? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The image, a workman hath cast it, and the goldsmith overlayeth it with gold, and casteth for it silver chains.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> He that is too impoverished for such an oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a skilful workman to set up a graven image, that shall not be moved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> It is he that sitteth above the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> that bringeth princes to nothing; that maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Yea, they have not been planted; yea, they have not been sown; yea, their stock hath not taken root in the earth: moreover he bloweth upon them, and they wither, and the whirlwind taketh them away as stubble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> To whom then will ye liken me, that I should be equal to him? saith the Holy One.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Lift up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these, that bringeth out their host by number; he calleth them all by name; by the greatness of his might, and for that he is strong in power, not one is lacking.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Why sayest thou, O Ya’qub (Jacob), and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from تتراجراماتون, and the justice due to me is passed away from my Elokim? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? The everlasting Elokim, تتراجراماتون, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary; there is no searching of his understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> He giveth power to the faint; and to him that hath no might he increaseth strength.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> but they that wait for تتراجراماتون shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.
