<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Be ye therefore imitators of Elokim, as beloved children;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and walk in love, even as Al-Masih also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to Elokim for an odor of a sweet smell.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of [Bar Enosh] al-Masih and [Atik Yomin] Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of Elokim upon the sons of disobedience.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Be not ye therefore partakers with them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For ye were once darkness, but are now light in HaAdon: walk as children of light 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> (for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> proving what is well-pleasing unto HaAdon; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Al-Masih shall shine upon thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of HaAdon is.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to HaAdon; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> giving thanks always for all things in the name of our [Bar Enosh] Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] to Elokim, even the [Atik Yomin] Father; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For the husband is the head of the wife, as Al-Masih also is the head of the New Creation Masjid, being himself the saviour of the body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But as the New Creation Masjid is subject to Al-Masih, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Husbands, love your wives, even as Al-Masih also loved the New Creation Masjid, and gave himself up for it; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> that he might present the New Creation Masjid to himself a glorious New Creation Masjid, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies.
<br>
 He that loveth his own wife loveth himself: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Al-Masih also the New Creation Masjid; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> because we are members of his body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Al-Masih and of the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.
