<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The word of تتراجراماتون came again unto me, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: Wail ye, Alas for the day! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For the day is near, even the day of تتراجراماتون is near; it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And a sword shall come upon Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mingled people, and Cub, and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: They also that uphold Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword, saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And they shall know that I am تتراجراماتون, when I have set a fire in Egypt, and all her helpers are destroyed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be anguish upon them, as in the day of Egypt; for, lo, it cometh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations, shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate, and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers: I, تتراجراماتون, have spoken it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis; and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt: and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan, and will execute judgments upon No.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, the stronghold of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And I will set a fire in Egypt: Sin shall be in great anguish, and No shall be broken up; and Memphis shall have adversaries in the day-time.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword; and these cities shall go into captivity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thus will I execute judgments upon Egypt; and they shall know that I am تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, lo, it hath not been bound up, to apply healing medicines, to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Therefore thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong arm, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put my sword in his hand: but I will break the arms of Pharaoh, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am تتراجراماتون, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them through the countries; and they shall know that I am تتراجراماتون.
