<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now it came to pass after the death of Musa the servant of تتراجراماتون, that تتراجراماتون spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun, Musa’ minister, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Musa my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you have I given it, as I spoke unto Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Musa, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Be strong and of good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers to give them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according to all the law, which Musa my servant commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest have good success whithersoever thou goest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate thereon day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not affrighted, neither be thou dismayed: for تتراجراماتون thy Elokim is with thee whithersoever thou goest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which تتراجراماتون your Elokim giveth you to possess it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, spoke Joshua, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Remember the word which Musa the servant of تتراجراماتون commanded you, saying, تتراجراماتون your Elokim giveth you rest, and will give you this land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Musa gave you beyond the Jordan; but ye shall pass over before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> until تتراجراماتون have given your brethren rest, as he hath given you, and they also have possessed the land which تتراجراماتون your Elokim giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Musa the servant of تتراجراماتون gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrising.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> According as we hearkened unto Musa in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only تتراجراماتون thy Elokim be with thee, as he was with Musa.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Whosoever he be that shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of good courage.
