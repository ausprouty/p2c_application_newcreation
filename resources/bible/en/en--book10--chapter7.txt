<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass, when the king dwelt in his house, and تتراجراماتون had given him rest from all his enemies round about,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> that the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of Elokim dwelleth within curtains.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart; for تتراجراماتون is with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And it came to pass the same night, that the word of تتراجراماتون came unto Nathan, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Go and tell my servant David (Dawad), Thus saith تتراجراماتون, Shalt thou build me a house for me to dwell in? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> In all places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to be shepherd of my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedar? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David (Dawad), Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be prince over my people, over Israel; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and I have been with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee; and I will make thee a great name, like unto the name of the great ones that are in the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place, and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as at the first, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and as from the day that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel; and I will cause thee to rest from all thine enemies.
<br>
 Moreover تتراجراماتون telleth thee that تتراجراماتون will make thee a house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> When thy days are fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, that shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I will be his father, and he shall be my son: if he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> but my lovingkindness shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And thy house and thy kingdom shall be made sure for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Then David (Dawad) the king went in, and sat before تتراجراماتون; and he said, Who am I, O Lord تتراجراماتون, and what is my house, that thou hast brought me thus far? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And this was yet a small thing in thine eyes, O Lord تتراجراماتون; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come; and this too after the manner of men, O Lord تتراجراماتون! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And what can David (Dawad) say more unto thee? for thou knowest thy servant, O Lord تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou wrought all this greatness, to make thy servant know it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Wherefore thou art great, O تتراجراماتون Elokim: for there is none like thee, neither is there any Elokim besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom Elokim went to redeem unto himself for a people, and to make him a name, and to do great things for you, and terrible things for thy land, before thy people, whom thou redeemest to thee out of Egypt, from the nations and their Elokim? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And thou didst establish to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever; and thou, تتراجراماتون, becamest their Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And now, O تتراجراماتون Elokim, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, confirm thou it for ever, and do as thou hast spoken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, تتراجراماتون of hosts is Elokim over Israel; and the house of thy servant David (Dawad) shall be established before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For thou, O تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And now, O Lord تتراجراماتون, thou art Elokim, and thy words are truth, and thou hast promised this good thing unto thy servant: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord تتراجراماتون, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.
