<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Call now; is there any that will answer thee?
<br>
And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For vexation killeth the foolish man,
<br>
And jealousy slayeth the silly one.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I have seen the foolish taking root:
<br>
But suddenly I cursed his habitation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> His children are far from safety,
<br>
And they are crushed in the gate,
<br>
Neither is there any to deliver them:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up,
<br>
And taketh it even out of the thorns;
<br>
And the snare gapeth for their substance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For affliction cometh not forth from the dust,
<br>
Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But man is born unto trouble,
<br>
As the sparks fly upward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But as for me, I would seek unto Elokim,
<br>
And unto Elokim would I commit my cause;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Who doeth great things and unsearchable,
<br>
Marvellous things without number:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Who giveth rain upon the earth,
<br>
And sendeth waters upon the fields;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> So that he setteth up on high those that are low,
<br>
And those that mourn are exalted to safety.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> He frustrateth the devices of the crafty,
<br>
So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> He taketh the wise in their own craftiness;
<br>
And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> They meet with darkness in the day-time,
<br>
And grope at noonday as in the night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But he saveth from the sword of their mouth,
<br>
Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> So the poor hath hope,
<br>
And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Behold, happy is the man whom Elokim correcteth:
<br>
Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For he maketh sore, and bindeth up;
<br>
He woundeth, and his hands make whole.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He will deliver thee in six troubles;
<br>
Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> In famine he will redeem thee from death;
<br>
And in war from the power of the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue;
<br>
Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh;
<br>
Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field;
<br>
And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace;
<br>
And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great,
<br>
And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age,
<br>
Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Lo this, we have searched it, so it is;
<br>
Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
