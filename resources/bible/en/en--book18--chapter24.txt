<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Why are times not laid up by the Almighty?
<br>
And why do not they that know him see his days?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> There are that remove the landmarks;
<br>
They violently take away flocks, and feed them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> They drive away the ass of the fatherless;
<br>
They take the widowâ€™s ox for a pledge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> They turn the needy out of the way:
<br>
The poor of the earth all hide themselves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Behold, as wild asses in the desert
<br>
They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food;
<br>
The wilderness yieldeth them bread for their children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> They cut their provender in the field;
<br>
And they glean the vintage of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> They lie all night naked without clothing,
<br>
And have no covering in the cold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> They are wet with the showers of the mountains,
<br>
And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast,
<br>
And take a pledge of the poor;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> So that they go about naked without clothing,
<br>
And being hungry they carry the sheaves.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> They make oil within the walls of these men;
<br>
They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> From out of the populous city men groan,
<br>
And the soul of the wounded crieth out:
<br>
Yet Elokim regardeth not the folly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> These are of them that rebel against the light;
<br>
They know not the ways thereof,
<br>
Nor abide in the paths thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The murderer riseth with the light;
<br>
He killeth the poor and needy;
<br>
And in the night he is as a thief.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
<br>
Saying, No eye shall see me:
<br>
And he disguiseth his face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> In the dark they dig through houses:
<br>
They shut themselves up in the day-time;
<br>
They know not the light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness;
<br>
For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Swiftly they pass away upon the face of the waters;
<br>
Their portion is cursed in the earth:
<br>
They turn not into the way of the vineyards.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Drought and heat consume the snow waters:
<br>
So doth Sheol those that have sinned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> The womb shall forget him;
<br>
The worm shall feed sweetly on him;
<br>
He shall be no more remembered;
<br>
And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He devoureth the barren that beareth not,
<br>
And doeth not good to the widow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Yet Elokim preserveth the mighty by his power:
<br>
He riseth up that hath no assurance of life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Elokim giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon;
<br>
And his eyes are upon their ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone;
<br>
Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others,
<br>
And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar,
<br>
And make my speech nothing worth?
<br>
