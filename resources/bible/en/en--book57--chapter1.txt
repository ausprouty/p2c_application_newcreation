<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul, a prisoner of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the New Creation Masjid in thy house: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Grace to you and peace from Elokim our Father and HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I thank my Elokim always, making mention of thee in my prayers, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and toward all the saints; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Wherefore, though I have all boldness in al-Masih to enjoin thee that which is befitting, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> who once was unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the Holy Injil: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in HaAdon: refresh my heart in al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], saluteth thee;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas [T.N. See warning of 2 Timothy 4:10, for Demas fell, though he was in the company here of three authors of Scripture, Mark, Luke, and Paul. Therefore it is unwise to boast of great teachers and great men of God you have been associated with, since such association had no impact on the treacherous, backsldden heart of Demas. See the Drama on Youtube, The Rabbi From Tarsus.], Luke, my fellow-workers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> The grace of our Lord [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] be with your spirit. Amen.
