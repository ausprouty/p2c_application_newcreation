<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah (the same was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon),
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty years, the word of تتراجراماتون hath come unto me, and I have spoken unto you, rising up early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And تتراجراماتون hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets, rising up early and sending them, (but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> saying, Return ye now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that تتراجراماتون hath given unto you and to your fathers, from of old and even for evermore; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and go not after other Elokim to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith تتراجراماتون; that ye may provoke me to anger with the work of your hands to your own hurt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Therefore thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: Because ye have not heard my words, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith تتراجراماتون, and I will send unto Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith تتراجراماتون, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans; and I will make it desolate for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For many nations and great kings shall make bondmen of them, even of them; and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the work of their hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, unto me: Take this cup of the wine of wrath at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Then took I the cup at تتراجراماتون’s hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom تتراجراماتون had sent me: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> to wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof, and the princes thereof, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Pharaoh king of Egypt, and his servants, and his princes, and all his people; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and all the mingled people, and all the kings of the land of Uz, and all the kings of the Philistines, and Ashkelon, and Gaza, and Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Edom, and Moab, and the children of Ammon; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> and all the kings of Tyre, and all the kings of Sidon, and the kings of the isle which is beyond the sea; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that have the corners of their hair cut off; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the wilderness; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> and all the kings of Zimri, and all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of the Medes; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the face of the earth: and the king of Sheshach shall drink after them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel: Drink ye, and be drunken, and spew, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts: Ye shall surely drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> For, lo, I begin to work evil at the city which is called by my name; and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished; for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, تتراجراماتون will roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he will mightily roar against his fold; he will give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> A noise shall come even to the end of the earth; for تتراجراماتون hath a controversy with the nations; he will enter into judgment with all flesh: as for the wicked, he will give them to the sword, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great tempest shall be raised up from the uttermost parts of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And the slain of تتراجراماتون shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the face of the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Wail, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow in ashes, ye principal of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are fully come, and ye shall fall like a goodly vessel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor the principal of the flock to escape.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and the wailing of the principal of the flock! for تتراجراماتون layeth waste their pasture.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And the peaceable folds are brought to silence because of the fierce anger of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> He hath left his covert, as the lion; for their land is become an astonishment because of the fierceness of the oppressing sword, and because of his fierce anger.
