<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> by the lot of their inheritance, as تتراجراماتون commanded by Musa, for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For Musa had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For the children of Yusuf (Joseph) were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> As تتراجراماتون commanded Musa, so the children of Israel did; and they divided the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa the man of Elokim concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Forty years old was I when Musa the servant of تتراجراماتون sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I wholly followed تتراجراماتون my Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Musa sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed تتراجراماتون my Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And now, behold, تتراجراماتون hath kept me alive, as he spoke, these forty and five years, from the time that تتراجراماتون spoke this word unto Musa, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Musa sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, and to go out and to come in.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Now therefore give me this hill-country, whereof تتراجراماتون spoke in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fortified: it may be that تتراجراماتون will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as تتراجراماتون spoke.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance. [T.N. Isaiah 49:8 says that the Messiah will be a new "Joshua" and the agent of تتراجراماتون, through whom comes the inheritance; a high priest by that same name (Zechariah 3:8; 6:11-12) is also a sign man and namesake of the coming "Joshua" or "Yeshua" Messiah, whose name is Isa in Arabic.]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite unto this day; because that he wholly followed تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kiriath-arba; which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.
<br>
 And the land had rest from war.
