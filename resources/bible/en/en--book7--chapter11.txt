<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house; for thou art the son of another woman.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they went out with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And it came to pass after a while, that the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And it was so, that, when the children of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and they said unto Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we may fight with the children of Ammon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and drive me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore are we turned again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight with the children of Ammon; and thou shalt be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight with the children of Ammon, and تتراجراماتون deliver them before me, shall I be your head? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, تتراجراماتون shall be witness between us; surely according to thy word so will we do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and chief over them: and Jephthah spoke all his words before تتراجراماتون in Mizpah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come unto me to fight against my land? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out of Egypt, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and unto the Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of Ammon; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and he said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah: Israel took not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness unto the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land; but the king of Edom hearkened not.
<br>
 And in like manner he sent unto the king of Moab; but he would not: and Israel abode in Kadesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side of the Arnon; but they came not within the border of Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land unto my place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even unto the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> So now تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, hath dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy Elokim giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever تتراجراماتون our Elokim hath dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And now art thou anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years; wherefore did ye not recover them within that time? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: تتراجراماتون, the Judge, be judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the words of Jephthah which he sent him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Then the Spirit of تتراجراماتون came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And Jephthah vowed a vow unto تتراجراماتون, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be تتراجراماتون’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight against them; and تتراجراماتون delivered them into his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and unto Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter.
<br>
 So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And Jephthah came to Mizpah unto his house; and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me; for I have opened my mouth unto تتراجراماتون, and I cannot go back.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And she said unto him, My father, thou hast opened thy mouth unto تتراجراماتون; do unto me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth, forasmuch as تتراجراماتون hath taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even on the children of Ammon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And he said, Go.
<br>
 And he sent her away for two months: and she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed: and she knew not man.
<br>
 And it was a custom in Israel, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.
