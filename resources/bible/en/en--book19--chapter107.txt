<sup class="versenum">1</sup> O give thanks unto تتراجراماتون; for he is good;
<br>
For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Let the redeemed of تتراجراماتون say so,
<br>
Whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the adversary,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And gathered out of the lands,
<br>
From the east and from the west,
<br>
From the north and from the south.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way;
<br>
They found no city of habitation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Hungry and thirsty,
<br>
Their soul fainted in them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Then they cried unto تتراجراماتون in their trouble,
<br>
And he delivered them out of their distresses,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He led them also by a straight way,
<br>
That they might go to a city of habitation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Oh that men would praise تتراجراماتون for his lovingkindness,
<br>
And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For he satisfieth the longing soul,
<br>
And the hungry soul he filleth with good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death,
<br>
Being bound in affliction and iron,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Because they rebelled against the words of Elokim,
<br>
And contemned the counsel of the Most High:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Therefore he brought down their heart with labor;
<br>
They fell down, and there was none to help.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then they cried unto تتراجراماتون in their trouble,
<br>
And he saved them out of their distresses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,
<br>
And brake their bonds in sunder.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Oh that men would praise تتراجراماتون for his lovingkindness,
<br>
And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For he hath broken the gates of brass,
<br>
And cut the bars of iron in sunder.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Fools because of their transgression,
<br>
And because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Their soul abhorreth all manner of food;
<br>
And they draw near unto the gates of death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Then they cry unto تتراجراماتون in their trouble,
<br>
And he saveth them out of their distresses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> He sendeth his word, and healeth them,
<br>
And delivereth them from their destructions. [T.N. The Bar Enosh has authority to forgive and heal, Mark 2:10; see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; compare "palach" an aramaic word in Daniel 3:12 and Daniel 7:13-14 regarding the matter of deity.]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Oh that men would praise تتراجراماتون for his lovingkindness,
<br>
And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving,
<br>
And declare his works with singing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> They that go down to the sea in ships,
<br>
That do business in great waters;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> These see the works of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And his wonders in the deep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind,
<br>
Which lifteth up the waves thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> They mount up to the heavens, they go down again to the depths:
<br>
Their soul melteth away because of trouble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man,
<br>
And are at their wits’ end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Then they cry unto تتراجراماتون in their trouble,
<br>
And he bringeth them out of their distresses.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> He maketh the storm a calm,
<br>
So that the waves thereof are still.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Then are they glad because they are quiet;
<br>
So he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Oh that men would praise تتراجراماتون for his lovingkindness,
<br>
And for his wonderful works to the children of men!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,
<br>
And praise him in the seat of the elders.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> He turneth rivers into a wilderness,
<br>
And watersprings into a thirsty ground;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> A fruitful land into a salt desert,
<br>
For the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> He turneth a wilderness into a pool of water,
<br>
And a dry land into watersprings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And there he maketh the hungry to dwell,
<br>
That they may prepare a city of habitation,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And sow fields, and plant vineyards,
<br>
And get them fruits of increase.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
<br>
And he suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> Again, they are diminished and bowed down
<br>
Through oppression, trouble, and sorrow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> He poureth contempt upon princes,
<br>
And causeth them to wander in the waste, where there is no way.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Yet setteth he the needy on high from affliction,
<br>
And maketh him families like a flock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> The upright shall see it, and be glad;
<br>
And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> Whoso is wise will give heed to these things;
<br>
And they will consider the lovingkindnesses of تتراجراماتون.
