<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Can a man be profitable unto Elokim?
<br>
Surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?
<br>
Or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee,
<br>
That he entereth with thee into judgment?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Is not thy wickedness great?
<br>
Neither is there any end to thine iniquities.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought,
<br>
And stripped the naked of their clothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink,
<br>
And thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But as for the mighty man, he had the earth;
<br>
And the honorable man, he dwelt in it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thou hast sent widows away empty,
<br>
And the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Therefore snares are round about thee,
<br>
And sudden fear troubleth thee,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Or darkness, so that thou canst not see,
<br>
And abundance of waters cover thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Is not Elokim in the height of heaven?
<br>
And behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And thou sayest, What doth Elokim know?
<br>
Can he judge through the thick darkness?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he seeth not;
<br>
And he walketh on the vault of heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Wilt thou keep the old way
<br>
Which wicked men have trodden?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Who were snatched away before their time,
<br>
Whose foundation was poured out as a stream,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Who said unto Elokim, Depart from us;
<br>
And, What can the Almighty do for us?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Yet he filled their houses with good things:
<br>
But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The righteous see it, and are glad;
<br>
And the innocent laugh them to scorn,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off,
<br>
And the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace:
<br>
Thereby good shall come unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth,
<br>
And lay up his words in thy heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up,
<br>
If thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And lay thou thy treasure in the dust,
<br>
And the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And the Almighty will be thy treasure,
<br>
And precious silver unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty,
<br>
And shalt lift up thy face unto Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee;
<br>
And thou shalt pay thy vows.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee;
<br>
And light shall shine upon thy ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up;
<br>
And the humble person he will save.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> He will deliver even him that is not innocent:
<br>
Yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thy hands.
