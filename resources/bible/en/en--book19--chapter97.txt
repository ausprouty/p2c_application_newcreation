<sup class="versenum">1</sup> تتراجراماتون reigneth; let the earth rejoice;
<br>
Let the multitude of isles be glad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Clouds and darkness are round about him:
<br>
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> A fire goeth before him,
<br>
And burneth up his adversaries round about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> His lightnings lightened the world:
<br>
The earth saw, and trembled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The mountains melted like wax at the presence of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
At the presence of HaAdon of the whole earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The heavens declare his righteousness,
<br>
And all the peoples have seen his glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Let all them be put to shame that serve graven images,
<br>
That boast themselves of idols:
<br>
Worship him, all ye Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Zion heard and was glad,
<br>
And the daughters of Judah rejoiced,
<br>
Because of thy judgments, O تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For thou, تتراجراماتون, art most high above all the earth:
<br>
Thou art exalted far above all Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> O ye that love تتراجراماتون, hate evil:
<br>
He preserveth the souls of his saints;
<br>
He delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Light is sown for the righteous,
<br>
And gladness for the upright in heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Be glad in تتراجراماتون, ye righteous;
<br>
And give thanks to his holy memorial name.
