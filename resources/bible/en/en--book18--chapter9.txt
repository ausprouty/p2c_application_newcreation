<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then Ayyub (Job) answered and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Of a truth I know that it is so:
<br>
But how can man be just with Elokim?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> If he be pleased to contend with him,
<br>
He cannot answer him one of a thousand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength:
<br>
Who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?â€™
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Him that removeth the mountains, and they know it not,
<br>
When he overturneth them in his anger;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> That shaketh the earth out of its place,
<br>
And the pillars thereof tremble;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> That commandeth the sun, and it riseth not,
<br>
And sealeth up the stars;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> That alone stretcheth out the heavens,
<br>
And treadeth upon the waves of the sea;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> That maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
<br>
And the chambers of the south;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> That doeth great things past finding out,
<br>
Yea, marvellous things without number.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not:
<br>
He passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder him?
<br>
Who will say unto him, What doest thou?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Elokim will not withdraw his anger;
<br>
The helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> How much less shall I answer him,
<br>
And choose out my words to reason with him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer;
<br>
I would make supplication to my judge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> If I had called, and he had answered me,
<br>
Yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For he breaketh me with a tempest,
<br>
And multiplieth my wounds without cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He will not suffer me to take my breath,
<br>
But filleth me with bitterness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> If we speak of strength, lo, he is mighty!
<br>
And if of justice, Who, saith he, will summon me?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me:
<br>
Though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> I am perfect; I regard not myself;
<br>
I despise my life.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> It is all one; therefore I say,
<br>
He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> If the scourge slay suddenly,
<br>
He will mock at the trial of the innocent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> The earth is given into the hand of the wicked;
<br>
He covereth the faces of the judges thereof:
<br>
If it be not he, who then is it?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Now my days are swifter than a post:
<br>
They flee away, they see no good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> They are passed away as the swift ships;
<br>
As the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> If I say, I will forget my complaint,
<br>
I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> I am afraid of all my sorrows,
<br>
I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> I shall be condemned;
<br>
Why then do I labor in vain?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> If I wash myself with snow water,
<br>
And make my hands never so clean;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch,
<br>
And mine own clothes shall abhor me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him,
<br>
That we should come together in judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> There is no arbitrator between us,
<br>
That might lay his hand upon us both.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Let him take his rod away from me,
<br>
And let not his terror make me afraid:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Then would I speak, and not fear him;
<br>
For I am not so in myself.
