<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Haron (Aaron), Thou and thy sons and thy fathers’ house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary; and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And thy brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou near with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall be before the tent of the testimony.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the Tent: only they shall not come nigh unto the vessels of the sanctuary and unto the altar, that they die not, neither they, nor ye.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar; that there be wrath no more upon the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are a gift, given unto تتراجراماتون, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and ye shall serve: I give you the priesthood as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Haron (Aaron), And I, behold, I have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings, even all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, as a portion for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, even every meal-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> As the most holy things shalt thou eat thereof; every male shall eat thereof: it shall be holy unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And this is thine: the heave-offering of their gift, even all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel; I have given them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage, and of the grain, the first-fruits of them which they give unto تتراجراماتون, to thee have I given them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they bring unto تتراجراماتون, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Everything that openeth the womb, of all flesh which they offer unto تتراجراماتون, both of man and beast shall be thine: nevertheless the first-born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And those that are to be redeemed of them from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary (the same is twenty gerahs).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right thigh, it shall be thine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer unto تتراجراماتون, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy daughters with thee, as a portion for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before تتراجراماتون unto thee and to thy seed with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Haron (Aaron), Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any portion among them: I am thy portion and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And unto the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And henceforth the children of Israel shall not come nigh the tent of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations; and among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering unto تتراجراماتون, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Moreover thou shalt speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithe which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for تتراجراماتون, a tithe of the tithe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And your heave-offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though it were the grain of the threshing-floor, and as the fulness of the winepress.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering unto تتراجراماتون of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and thereof ye shall give تتراجراماتون’s heave-offering to Haron (Aaron) the priest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of تتراجراماتون, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye heave the best thereof from it, then it shall be reckoned unto the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best thereof: and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.
