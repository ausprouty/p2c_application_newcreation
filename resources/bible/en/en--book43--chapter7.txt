<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And after these things [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judaea, because the Jews sought to kill him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly.
<br>
 If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For even his brethren did not believe on him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And having said these things unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Yet no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But when it was now the midst of the feast [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]went up into the temple, and taught.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore answered them, and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of Elokim, or whether I speak from myself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Did not Musa give you the law, and yet none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Musa hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Musa, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Musa may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him.
<br>
 Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is al-Masih? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when al-Masih cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When al-Masih shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet given; because [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]was not yet glorified.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Others said, This is al-Masih.
<br>
 But some said, What, doth al-Masih come out of Galilee? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> Hath not the scripture said that al-Masih cometh of the seed of David (Dawad), and from Bethlehem, the village where David (Dawad) was? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> The officers answered, Never man so spoke.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> *[And they went every man unto his own house:
