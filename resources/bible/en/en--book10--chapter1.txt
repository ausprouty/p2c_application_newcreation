<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David (Dawad) was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David (Dawad) had abode two days in Ziklag;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David (Dawad), that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.
<br>
 And he answered, The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen followed hard after him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me.
<br>
 And I answered, Here am I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he said unto me, Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me; for anguish hath taken hold of me, because my life is yet whole in me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Then David (Dawad) took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of تتراجراماتون, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy تتراجراماتون’s anointed? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And David (Dawad) called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him.
<br>
 And he smote him, so that he died.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And David (Dawad) said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain تتراجراماتون’s anointed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And David (Dawad) lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> (and he bade them teach the children of Judah the song of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jashar):
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places!
<br>
How are the mighty fallen!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Ye mountains of Gilboa,
<br>
Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, neither fields of offerings:
<br>
For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away,
<br>
The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,
<br>
The bow of Jonathan turned not back,
<br>
And the sword of Saul returned not empty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,
<br>
And in their death they were not divided:
<br>
They were swifter than eagles,
<br>
They were stronger than lions.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
<br>
Who clothed you in scarlet delicately,
<br>
Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!
<br>
Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:
<br>
Very pleasant hast thou been unto me:
<br>
Thy love to me was wonderful,
<br>
Passing the love of women.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> How are the mighty fallen,
<br>
And the weapons of war perished!
