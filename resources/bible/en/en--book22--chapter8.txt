<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Oh that thou wert as my brother,
<br>
That sucked the breasts of my mother!
<br>
When I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
<br>
Yea, and none would despise me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother’s house,
<br>
Who would instruct me;
<br>
I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine,
<br>
Of the juice of my pomegranate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> His left hand should be under my head,
<br>
And his right hand should embrace me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
<br>
That ye stir not up, nor awake my love,
<br>
Until he please.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness,
<br>
Leaning upon her beloved?
<br>
Under the apple-tree I awakened thee:
<br>
There thy mother was in travail with thee,
<br>
There was she in travail that brought thee forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Set me as a seal upon thy heart,
<br>
As a seal upon thine arm:
<br>
For love is strong as death;
<br>
Jealousy is cruel as Sheol;
<br>
The flashes thereof are flashes of fire,
<br>
A very flame of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Many waters cannot quench love,
<br>
Neither can floods drown it:
<br>
If a man would give all the substance of his house for love,
<br>
He would utterly be contemned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> We have a little sister,
<br>
And she hath no breasts:
<br>
What shall we do for our sister
<br>
In the day when she shall be spoken for?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> If she be a wall,
<br>
We will build upon her a turret of silver:
<br>
And if she be a door,
<br>
We will inclose her with boards of cedar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> I am a wall, and my breasts like the towers thereof
<br>
Then was I in his eyes as one that found peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon;
<br>
He let out the vineyard unto keepers;
<br>
Every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> My vineyard, which is mine, is before me:
<br>
Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand,
<br>
And those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou that dwellest in the gardens,
<br>
The companions hearken for thy voice:
<br>
Cause me to hear it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Make haste, my beloved,
<br>
And be thou like to a roe or to a young hart
<br>
Upon the mountains of spices.
