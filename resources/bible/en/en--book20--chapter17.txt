<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith,
<br>
Than a house full of feasting with strife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
<br>
And shall have part in the inheritance among the brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold;
<br>
But تتراجراماتون trieth the hearts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> An evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips;
<br>
And a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker;
<br>
And he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Children’s children are the crown of old men;
<br>
And the glory of children are their fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Excellent speech becometh not a fool;
<br>
Much less do lying lips a prince.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> A bribe is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it;
<br>
Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He that covereth a transgression seeketh love;
<br>
But he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding
<br>
Than a hundred stripes into a fool.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> An evil man seeketh only rebellion;
<br>
Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man,
<br>
Rather than a fool in his folly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Whoso rewardeth evil for good,
<br>
Evil shall not depart from his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
<br>
Therefore leave off contention, before there is quarrelling.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous,
<br>
Both of them alike are an abomination to تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy [T.N. See this same Hebrew word in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41] wisdom, Seeing he hath no understanding?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> A friend loveth at all times;
<br>
And a brother is born for adversity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> A man void of understanding striketh hands,
<br>
And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He loveth transgression that loveth strife:
<br>
He that raiseth high his gate seeketh destruction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> He that hath a wayward heart findeth no good;
<br>
And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow;
<br>
And the father of a fool hath no joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> A cheerful heart is a good medicine;
<br>
But a broken spirit drieth up the bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> A wicked man receiveth a bribe out of the bosom,
<br>
To pervert the ways of justice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Wisdom is before the face of him that hath understanding;
<br>
But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> A foolish son is a grief to his father,
<br>
And bitterness to her that bare him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Also to punish the righteous is not good,
<br>
Nor to smite the noble for their uprightness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> He that spareth his words hath knowledge;
<br>
And he that is of a cool spirit is a man of understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise;
<br>
When he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent.
