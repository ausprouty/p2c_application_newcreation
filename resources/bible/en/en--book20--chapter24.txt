<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Be not thou envious against evil men;
<br>
Neither desire to be with them:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For their heart studieth oppression,
<br>
And their lips talk of mischief.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Through wisdom is a house builded;
<br>
And by understanding it is established;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And by knowledge are the chambers filled
<br>
With all precious and pleasant riches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> A wise man is strong;
<br>
Yea, a man of knowledge increaseth might.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For by wise guidance thou shalt make thy war;
<br>
And in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Wisdom is too high for a fool:
<br>
He openeth not his mouth in the gate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He that deviseth to do evil,
<br>
Men shall call him a mischief-maker.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> The thought of foolishness is sin;
<br>
And the scoffer is an abomination to men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> If thou faint in the day of adversity,
<br>
Thy strength is small.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Deliver them that are carried away unto death,
<br>
And those that are ready to be slain see that thou hold back.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> If thou sayest, Behold, we knew not this;
<br>
Doth not he that weigheth the hearts consider it?
<br>
And he that keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it?
<br>
And shall not he render to every man according to his work?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> My son, eat thou honey, for it is good;
<br>
And the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to thy taste:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> So shalt thou know wisdom to be unto thy soul;
<br>
If thou hast found it, then shall there be a reward,
<br>
And thy hope shall not be cut off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous;
<br>
Destroy not his resting-place:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For a righteous man falleth seven times, and riseth up again;
<br>
But the wicked are overthrown by calamity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth,
<br>
And let not thy heart be glad when he is overthrown;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Lest تتراجراماتون see it, and it displease him,
<br>
And he turn away his wrath from him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Fret not thyself because of evil-doers;
<br>
Neither be thou envious at the wicked:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For there shall be no reward to the evil man;
<br>
The lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> My son, fear thou تتراجراماتون and the king;
<br>
And company not with them that are given to change:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For their calamity shall rise suddenly;
<br>
And the destruction from them both, who knoweth it?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> These also are sayings of the wise.
<br>
To have respect of persons in judgment is not good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous,
<br>
Peoples shall curse him, nations shall abhor him;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But to them that rebuke him shall be delight,
<br>
And a good blessing shall come upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> He kisseth the lips
<br>
Who giveth a right answer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Prepare thy work without,
<br>
And make it ready for thee in the field;
<br>
And afterwards build thy house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Be not a witness against thy neighbor without cause;
<br>
And deceive not with thy lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me;
<br>
I will render to the man according to his work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> I went by the field of the sluggard,
<br>
And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns,
<br>
The face thereof was covered with nettles,
<br>
And the stone wall thereof was broken down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Then I beheld, and considered well;
<br>
I saw, and received instruction:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Yet a little sleep, a little slumber,
<br>
A little folding of the hands to sleep;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> So shall thy poverty come as a robber,
<br>
And thy want as an armed man.
