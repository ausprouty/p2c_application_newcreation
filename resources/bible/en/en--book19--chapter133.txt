<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Song of Ascents; of Dawad) Behold, how good and how pleasant it is
<br>
For brethren to dwell together in unity!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> It is like the precious oil upon the head,
<br>
That ran down upon the beard,
<br>
Even Haron (Aaron)’s beard;
<br>
That came down upon the skirt of his garments;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Like the dew of Hermon,
<br>
That cometh down upon the mountains of Zion:
<br>
For there تتراجراماتون commanded the blessing,
<br>
Even life for evermore.
