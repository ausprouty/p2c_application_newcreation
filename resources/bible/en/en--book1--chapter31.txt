<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he heard the words of Laban’s sons, saying, Ya’qub (Jacob) hath taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s hath he gotten all this glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as beforetime.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Ya’qub (Jacob), Return unto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his flock, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as beforetime; but the Elokim of my father hath been with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but Elokim suffered him not to hurt me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the flock bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstreaked shall be thy wages; then bare all the flock ringstreaked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thus Elokim hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And it came to pass at the time that the flock conceive, that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold, the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the angel of Elokim said unto me in the dream, Ya’qub (Jacob): and I said, Here am I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see: all the he-goats which leap upon the flock are ringstreaked, speckled, and grizzled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I am the Elokim of Beth-el, where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Are we not accounted by him as foreigners? for he hath sold us, and hath also quite devoured our money.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For all the riches which Elokim hath taken away from our father, that is ours and our children’s: now then, whatsoever Elokim hath said unto thee, do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Then Ya’qub (Jacob) rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon the camels; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and he carried away all his cattle, and all his substance which he had gathered, the cattle of his getting, which he had gathered in Paddan-aram, to go to Ishaq (Isaac) his father unto the land of Canaan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Now Laban was gone to shear his sheep: and Rachel stole the teraphim that were her father’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he told him not that he fled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed over the River, and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And it was told Laban on the third day that Ya’qub (Jacob) was fled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and he overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Elokim came to Laban the Syrian in a dream of the night, and said unto him, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Ya’qub (Jacob) either good or bad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And Laban came up with Ya’qub (Jacob). Now Ya’qub (Jacob) had pitched his tent in the mountain: and Laban with his brethren encamped in the mountain of Gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And Laban said to Ya’qub (Jacob), What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters as captives of the sword? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Wherefore didst thou flee secretly, and steal away from me, and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs, with tabret and with harp; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> and didst not suffer me to kiss my sons and my daughters? now hast thou done foolishly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the Elokim of your father spoke unto me yesternight, saying, Take heed to thyself that thou speak not to Ya’qub (Jacob) either good or bad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore longedst after thy father’s house, yet wherefore hast thou stolen my Elokim? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Lest thou shouldest take thy daughters from me by force.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> With whomsoever thou findest thy Elokim, he shall not live: before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and take it to thee.
<br>
 For Ya’qub (Jacob) knew not that Rachel had stolen them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And Laban went into Ya’qub’s tent, and into Leah’s tent, and into the tent of the two maid-servants; but he found them not.
<br>
 And he went out of Leah’s tent, and entered into Rachel’s tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, and put them in the camel’s saddle, and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And she said to her father, Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me.
<br>
 And he searched, but found not the teraphim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Ya’qub (Jacob) answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that thou hast hotly pursued after me? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Whereas thou hast felt about all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us two.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> These twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she-goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flocks have I not eaten.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from mine eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> These twenty years have I been in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy flock: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> Except the Elokim of my father, the Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), and the Fear of Ishaq (Isaac), had been with me, surely now hadst thou sent me away empty. Elokim hath seen mine affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And Laban answered and said unto Ya’qub (Jacob), The daughters are my daughters, and the children are my children, and the flocks are my flocks, and all that thou seest is mine: and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their children whom they have borne? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And now come, let us make a covenant, I and thou; and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones, and made a heap: and they did eat there by the heap.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And Laban called it Jegar-saha-dutha: but Ya’qub (Jacob) called it Galeed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And Laban said, This heap is witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> and Mizpah, for he said, تتراجراماتون watch between me and thee, when we are absent one from another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, and if thou shalt take wives besides my daughters, no man is with us; see, Elokim is witness betwixt me and thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> And Laban said to Ya’qub (Jacob), Behold this heap, and behold the pillar, which I have set betwixt me and thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> This heap be witness, and the pillar be witness, that I will not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> The Elokim of Ibrahim (Abraham), and the Elokim of Nahor, the Elokim of their father, judge betwixt us. And Ya’qub (Jacob) sware by the Fear of his father Ishaq (Isaac).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all night in the mountain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and returned unto his place.
