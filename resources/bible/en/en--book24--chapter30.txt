<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The word that came to Jeremiah from تتراجراماتون, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thus speaketh تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, saying, Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For, lo, the days come, saith تتراجراماتون, that I will turn again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith تتراجراماتون; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And these are the words that تتراجراماتون spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون: We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child: wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Ya’qub’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds; and strangers shall no more make him their bondman; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> but they shall serve تتراجراماتون their Elokim, and David (Dawad) their king, whom I will raise up unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Therefore fear thou not, O Ya’qub (Jacob) my servant, saith تتراجراماتون; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Ya’qub (Jacob) shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall make him afraid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For I am with thee, saith تتراجراماتون, to save thee: for I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, but I will not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in measure, and will in no wise leave thee unpunished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون, Thy hurt is incurable, and thy wound grievous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not: for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Why criest thou for thy hurt? thy pain is incurable: for the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that despoil thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith تتراجراماتون; because they have called thee an outcast, saying, It is Zion, whom no man seeketh after.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Thus saith تتراجراماتون: Behold, I will turn again the captivity of Ya’qub’s tents, and have compassion on his dwelling-places; and the city shall be builded upon its own hill, and the palace shall be inhabited after its own manner.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me; and I will punish all that oppress them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto me: for who is he that hath had boldness to approach unto me? saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Behold, the tempest of تتراجراماتون, even his wrath, is gone forth, a sweeping tempest: it shall burst upon the head of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> The fierce anger of تتراجراماتون shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall understand it.
