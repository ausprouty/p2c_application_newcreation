<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Song of Ascents; of Solomon) Except تتراجراماتون build the house,
<br>
They labor in vain that build it:
<br>
Except تتراجراماتون keep the city,
<br>
The watchman waketh but in vain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> It is vain for you to rise up early,
<br>
To take rest late,
<br>
To eat the bread of toil;
<br>
For so he giveth unto his beloved sleep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Lo, children are a heritage of تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And the fruit of the womb is his reward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> As arrows in the hand of a mighty man,
<br>
So are the children of youth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them:
<br>
They shall not be put to shame,
<br>
When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
