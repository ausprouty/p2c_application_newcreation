<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The burden of the valley of vision.
<br>
What aileth thee now, that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> O thou that art full of shoutings, a tumultuous city, a joyous town; thy slain are not slain with the sword, neither are they dead in battle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> All thy rulers fled away together, they were bound by the archers; all that were found of thee were bound together; they fled afar off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Therefore said I, Look away from me, I will weep bitterly; labor not to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For it is a day of discomfiture, and of treading down, and of perplexity, from HaAdon, تتراجراماتون of hosts, in the valley of vision; a breaking down of the walls, and a crying to the mountains.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Elam bare the quiver, with chariots of men and horsemen; and Kir uncovered the shield.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And it came to pass, that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the horsemen set themselves in array at the gate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And he took away the covering of Judah; and thou didst look in that day to the armor in the house of the forest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And ye saw the breaches of the city of David (Dawad), that they were many; and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and ye numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and ye brake down the houses to fortify the wall; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> ye made also a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool.
<br>
 But ye looked not unto him that had done this, neither had ye respect unto him that purposed it long ago.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And in that day did HaAdon, تتراجراماتون of hosts, call to weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and, behold, joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh and drinking wine: Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And تتراجراماتون of hosts revealed himself in mine ears, Surely this iniquity shall not be forgiven you till ye die, saith HaAdon, تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thus saith HaAdon, تتراجراماتون of hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, who is over the house, and say, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> What doest thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast hewed thee out here a sepulchre? hewing him out a sepulchre on high, graving a habitation for himself in the rock! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Behold, تتراجراماتون, like a strong man, will hurl thee away violently; yea, he will wrap thee up closely.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He will surely wind thee round and round, and toss thee like a ball into a large country; there shalt thou die, and there shall be the chariots of thy glory, thou shame of thy lord’s house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And I will thrust thee from thine office; and from thy station shalt thou be pulled down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to the house of Judah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And the key of the house of David (Dawad) will I lay upon his shoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall be for a throne of glory to his father’s house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the issue, every small vessel, from the cups even to all the flagons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> In that day, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, shall the nail that was fastened in a sure place give way; and it shall be hewn down, and fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off; for تتراجراماتون hath spoken it.
