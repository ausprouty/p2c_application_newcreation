<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Musa spoke unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that تتراجراماتون commanded Musa, so did the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And there were certain men, who were unclean by reason of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Musa and before Haron (Aaron) on that day: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> and those men said unto him, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of تتراجراماتون in its appointed season among the children of Israel? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Musa said unto them, Stay ye, that I may hear what تتراجراماتون will command concerning you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> In the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But the man that is clean, and is not on a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people; because he offered not the oblation of تتراجراماتون in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover [T.N.This verse reminds us of  the Exodus and the Passover and Isa the Qurbani Lamb of Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29 and John 19:14-16 and the fact that Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation.] unto تتراجراماتون; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the sojourner, and for him that is born in the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> At the commandment of تتراجراماتون the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of تتراجراماتون they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of تتراجراماتون, and journeyed not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of تتراجراماتون they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of تتراجراماتون they journeyed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> At the commandment of تتراجراماتون they encamped, and at the commandment of تتراجراماتون they journeyed: they kept the charge of تتراجراماتون, at the commandment of تتراجراماتون by Musa.
