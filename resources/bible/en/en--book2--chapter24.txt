<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he said unto Musa, Come up unto تتراجراماتون, thou, and Haron (Aaron), Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship ye afar off:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and Musa alone shall come near unto تتراجراماتون; but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And Musa came and told the people all the words of تتراجراماتون, and all the ordinances: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which تتراجراماتون hath spoken will we do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Musa wrote all the words of تتراجراماتون, and rose up early in the morning, and builded an altar under the mount, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt-offerings, and sacrificed peace-offerings of oxen unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Musa took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that تتراجراماتون hath spoken will we do, and be obedient.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Musa took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which تتراجراماتون hath made with you concerning all these words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Then went up Musa, and Haron (Aaron), Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And they saw the Elokim of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire stone, and as it were the very heaven for clearness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And upon the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: and they beheld Elokim, and did eat and drink.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give thee the tables of stone, and the law and the commandment, which I have written, that thou mayest teach them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Musa rose up, and Joshua his minister: and Musa went up into the mount of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he said unto the elders, Tarry ye here for us, until we come again unto you: and, behold, Haron (Aaron) and Hur are with you: whosoever hath a cause, let him come near unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And Musa went up into the mount, and the cloud covered the mount.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And the glory of تتراجراماتون abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called unto Musa out of the midst of the cloud.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the appearance of the glory of تتراجراماتون was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And Musa entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up into the mount: and Musa was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
