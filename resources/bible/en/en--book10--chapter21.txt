2 Samuel  21:1	 And there was a famine in the days of David (Dawad) three years, year after year; and David (Dawad) sought the face of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
 And تتراجراماتون said, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and David (Dawad) said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? and wherewith shall I make atonement, that ye may bless the inheritance of تتراجراماتون? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And the Gibeonites said unto him, It is no matter of silver or gold between us and Saul, or his house; neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.
<br>
 And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And they said unto the king, The man that consumed us, and that devised against us, that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the borders of Israel, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto تتراجراماتون in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
 And the king said, I will give them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of Saul, because of تتراجراماتون’s oath that was between them, between David (Dawad) and Jonathan the son of Saul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she bare to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them in the mountain before تتراجراماتون, and they fell all seven together.
<br>
 And they were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first days, at the beginning of barley harvest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water was poured upon them from heaven; and she suffered neither the birds of the heavens to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And it was told David (Dawad) what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And David (Dawad) went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the street of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them, in the day that the Philistines slew Saul in Gilboa; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son: and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and they performed all that the king commanded.
<br>
 And after that Elokim was entreated for the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And the Philistines had war again with Israel; and David (Dawad) went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines.
<br>
 And David (Dawad) waxed faint; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him.
<br>
 Then the men of David (Dawad) sware unto him, saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench not the lamp of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And it came to pass after this, that there was again war with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And there was again war with the Philistines at Gob; and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim the Beth-lehemite slew Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And there was again war at Gath, where was a man of great stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes, four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, slew him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> These four were born to the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David (Dawad), and by the hand of his servants.
