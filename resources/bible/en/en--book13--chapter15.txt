<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And David (Dawad) made him houses in the city of David (Dawad); and he prepared a place for the ark of Elokim, and pitched for it a tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Then David (Dawad) said, None ought to carry the ark of Elokim but the Levites: for them hath تتراجراماتون chosen to carry the ark of Elokim, and to minister unto him for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And David (Dawad) assembled all Israel at Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of تتراجراماتون unto its place, which he had prepared for it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And David (Dawad) gathered together the sons of Haron (Aaron), and the Levites: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twenty; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and his brethren a hundred and thirty; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and his brethren a hundred and twelve.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And David (Dawad) called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> and said unto them, Ye are the heads of the fathers’ houses of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel, unto the place that I have prepared for it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For because ye bare it not at the first, تتراجراماتون our Elokim made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not according to the ordinance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And the children of the Levites bare the ark of Elokim upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Musa commanded according to the word of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And David (Dawad) spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren the singers, with instruments of music, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding aloud and lifting up the voice with joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the doorkeepers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed, with cymbals of brass to sound aloud; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> and Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries set to Alamoth; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> and Mattithiah, and Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps set to the Sheminith, to lead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was over the song: he instructed about the song, because he was skilful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And Shebaniah, and Joshaphat, and Nethanel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow the trumpets before the ark of Elokim; and Obed-edom and Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> So David (Dawad), and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And it came to pass, when Elokim helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون, that they sacrificed seven bullocks and seven rams.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And David (Dawad) was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: and David (Dawad) had upon him an ephod of linen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, sounding aloud with psalteries and harps.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون came to the city of David (Dawad), that Michal the daughter of Saul looked out at the window, and saw king David (Dawad) dancing and playing; and she despised him in her heart.
