<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The beginning of the Holy Injil of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet,
<br>
Behold, I send my messenger before thy face,
<br>
Who shall prepare thy way;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The voice of one crying in the wilderness,
<br>
Make ye ready the way of HaAdon,
<br>
Make his paths straight;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> John came, who gave a baptism of repentance [T.N. See 2 Kings 5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that God can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (Romans 6:3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .] unto remission of sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were given a baptism of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I gave a baptism to you in water; but he shall baptize you in the Holy Ruach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And it came to pass in those days, that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was given a baptism  of John in the Jordan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], in thee I am well pleased.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Now after John was delivered up, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] came into Galilee, preaching the Holy Injil of Elokim, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of Elokim is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the Holy Injil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> saying, What have we to do with thee, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> And all the city was gathered together at the door.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And Simon and they that were with him followed after him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Musa commanded, for a testimony unto them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.
