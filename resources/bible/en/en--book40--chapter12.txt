<sup class="versenum">1</sup> At that season [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]went on the sabbath day through the grainfields; and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck ears and to eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But the Pharisees, when they saw it, said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David (Dawad) did, when he was hungry, and they that were with him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> how he entered into the house of Elokim, and ate the showbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them that were with him, but only for the priests? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath day the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are guiltless? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But I say unto you, that one greater than the temple is here.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But if ye had known what this meaneth, I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For the Bar Enosh is lord of the sabbath.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he departed thence, and went into their synagogue: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and behold, a man having a withered hand.
<br>
 And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? that they might accuse him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he said unto them, What man shall there be of you, that shall have one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> How much then is a man of more value than a sheep! Wherefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thy hand.
<br>
 And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, as the other.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But the Pharisees went out, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]perceiving it withdrew from thence: and many followed him; and he healed them all, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and charged them that they should not make him known: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;
<br>
My beloved in whom my soul is well pleased:
<br>
I will put my Spirit upon him,
<br>
And he shall declare judgment to the Gentiles.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> He shall not strive, nor cry aloud;
<br>
Neither shall any one hear his voice in the streets.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> A bruised reed shall he not break,
<br>
And smoking flax shall he not quench,
<br>
Till he send forth judgment unto victory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the dumb man spoke and saw.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And all the multitudes were amazed, and said, Can this be the son of David (Dawad)? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This man doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And knowing their thoughts he said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> and if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But if I by the Spirit of Elokim cast out demons, then is the kingdom of Elokim come upon you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Therefore I say unto you, Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men; but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> And whosoever shall speak a word against the Bar Enosh, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Ruach, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in that which is to come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by its fruit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Ye offspring of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> The good man out of his good treasure bringeth forth good things: and the evil man out of his evil treasure bringeth forth evil things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Then certain of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we would see a sign from thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of Yunus (Jonah) the prophet: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> for as Yunus (Jonah) was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; so shall the Bar Enosh be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> The men of Nineveh shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Yunus (Jonah); and behold, a greater than Yunus (Jonah) is here.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> But the unclean spirit, when he is gone out of the man, passeth through waterless places, seeking rest, and findeth it not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> Then he saith, I will return into my house whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man becometh worse than the first.
<br>
 Even so shall it be also unto this evil generation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> While he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking to speak to thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brethren? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and said, Behold, my mother and my brethren! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.
