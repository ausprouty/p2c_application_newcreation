<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and spoke with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And his mother’s brethren spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, who followed him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon one stone: but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that Elokim may hearken unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said unto the olive-tree, Reign thou over us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But the olive-tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness, wherewith by me they honor Elokim and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the trees said to the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But the fig-tree said unto them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the trees? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And the trees said unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheereth Elokim and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> (for my father fought for you, and adventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and ye are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Elokim sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> that the violence done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, who slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And the men of Shechem set liers-in-wait for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod the grapes, and held festival, and went into the house of their Elokim, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: but why should we serve him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And would that this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech.
<br>
 And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And he sent messengers unto Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren are come to Shechem; and, behold, they constrain the city to take part against thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and lie in wait in the field: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and rush upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from the ambushment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the tops of the mountains.
<br>
 And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And Gaal spoke again and said, See, there come people down by the middle of the land, and one company cometh by the way of the oak of Meonenim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, that thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that thou hast despised? go out now, I pray, and fight with them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even unto the entrance of the gate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">42</sup> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">43</sup> And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">44</sup> And Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city: and the two companies rushed upon all that were in the field, and smote them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">45</sup> And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that were therein: and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">46</sup> And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard thereof, they entered into the stronghold of the house of El-berith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">47</sup> And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">48</sup> And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder: and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">49</sup> And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">50</sup> Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">51</sup> But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut themselves in, and gat them up to the roof of the tower.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">52</sup> And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and drew near unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">53</sup> And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech’s head, and brake his skull.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">54</sup> Then he called hastily unto the young man his armorbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men say not of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">55</sup> And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man unto his place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">56</sup> Thus Elokim requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">57</sup> and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did Elokim requite upon their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.
