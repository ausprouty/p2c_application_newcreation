<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Prayer of Musa the man of Elokim) Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place
<br>
In all generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Before the mountains were brought forth,
<br>
Or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world,
<br>
Even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou turnest man to destruction,
<br>
And sayest, Return, ye children of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For a thousand years in thy sight
<br>
Are but as yesterday when it is past,
<br>
And as a watch in the night.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
<br>
In the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up;
<br>
In the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For we are consumed in thine anger,
<br>
And in thy wrath are we troubled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee,
<br>
Our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For all our days are passed away in thy wrath:
<br>
We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The days of our years are threescore years and ten,
<br>
Or even by reason of strength fourscore years;
<br>
Yet is their pride but labor and sorrow;
<br>
For it is soon gone, and we fly away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Who knoweth the power of thine anger,
<br>
And thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So teach us to number our days,
<br>
That we may get us a heart of wisdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Return, O تتراجراماتون; how long?
<br>
And let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Oh satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness,
<br>
That we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us,
<br>
And the years wherein we have seen evil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Let thy work appear unto thy servants,
<br>
And thy glory upon their children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And let the favor of HaAdon our Elokim be upon us;
<br>
And establish thou the work of our hands upon us;
<br>
Yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
