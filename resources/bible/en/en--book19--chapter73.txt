<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Psalm of Asaph) Surely Elokim is good to Israel,
<br>
Even to such as are pure in heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> But as for me, my feet were almost gone;
<br>
My steps had well nigh slipped.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For I was envious at the arrogant,
<br>
When I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For there are no pangs in their death;
<br>
But their strength is firm.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They are not in trouble as other men;
<br>
Neither are they plagued like other men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Therefore pride is as a chain about their neck;
<br>
Violence covereth them as a garment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Their eyes stand out with fatness:
<br>
They have more than heart could wish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> They scoff, and in wickedness utter oppression:
<br>
They speak loftily.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> They have set their mouth in the heavens,
<br>
And their tongue walketh through the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Therefore his people return hither:
<br>
And waters of a full cup are drained by them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And they say, How doth Elokim know?
<br>
And is there knowledge in the Most High?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Behold, these are the wicked;
<br>
And, being alway at ease, they increase in riches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Surely in vain have I cleansed my heart,
<br>
And washed my hands in innocency;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For all the day long have I been plagued,
<br>
And chastened every morning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> If I had said, I will speak thus;
<br>
Behold, I had dealt treacherously with the generation of thy children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> When I thought how I might know this,
<br>
It was too painful for me;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Until I went into the sanctuary of Elokim,
<br>
And considered their latter end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Surely thou settest them in slippery places:
<br>
Thou castest them down to destruction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> How are they become a desolation in a moment!
<br>
They are utterly consumed with terrors.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> As a dream when one awaketh,
<br>
So, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou wilt despise their image.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For my soul was grieved,
<br>
And I was pricked in my heart:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> So brutish was I, and ignorant;
<br>
I was as a beast before thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Nevertheless I am continually with thee:
<br>
Thou hast holden my right hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Thou wilt guide me with thy counsel,
<br>
And afterward receive me to glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Whom have I in heaven but thee?
<br>
And there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> My flesh and my heart faileth;
<br>
But Elokim is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish:
<br>
Thou hast destroyed all them that play the harlot, departing from thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> But it is good for me to draw near unto Elokim:
<br>
I have made HaAdon تتراجراماتون my refuge,
<br>
That I may tell of all thy works.
