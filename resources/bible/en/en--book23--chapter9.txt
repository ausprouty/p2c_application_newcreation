<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> But there shall be no gloom to her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali; but in the latter time hath he made it glorious, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased their joy: they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou hast broken as in the day of Midian.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For all the armor of the armed man in the tumult, and the garments rolled in blood, shall be for burning, for fuel of fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son [T.N. The Hebrew word is instructive in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41; only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; <sup class="versenum">5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17).] is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, El Gibbor, Avi Ad (Father or Possessor of Eternity, see especially T.N. on Micah 5:2), Prince of Peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David (Dawad), and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even for ever.
<br>
 The zeal of تتراجراماتون of hosts will perform this.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> HaAdon sent a word into Ya’qub (Jacob), and it hath lighted upon Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and in stoutness of heart, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The bricks are fallen, but we will build with hewn stone; the sycomores are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Therefore تتراجراماتون will set up on high against him the adversaries of Rezin, and will stir up his enemies, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth.
<br>
 For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Yet the people have not turned unto him that smote them, neither have they sought تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Therefore تتراجراماتون will cut off from Israel head and tail, palm-branch and rush, in one day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The elder and the honorable man, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For they that lead this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Therefore HaAdon will not rejoice over their young men, neither will he have compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is profane and an evil-doer, and every mouth speaketh folly.
<br>
 For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For wickedness burneth as the fire; it devoureth the briers and thorns; yea, it kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Through the wrath of تتراجراماتون of hosts is the land burnt up; and the people are as the fuel of fire: no man spareth his brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And one shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied: they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
