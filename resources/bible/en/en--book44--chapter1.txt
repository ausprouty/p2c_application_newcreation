<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The former treatise I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh] began both to do and to teach,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment through the Holy Ruach unto the apostles whom he had chosen: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> to whom he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing unto them by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of Elokim
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and, being assembled together with them, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, ye heard from me: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For John indeed gave a total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3)  with water; but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Ruach not many days hence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> They therefore, when they were come together, asked him, saying, Lord, dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And he said unto them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within his own authority.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But ye shall receive power, when the Holy Ruach is come upon you: and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea and Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And when he had said these things, as they were looking, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And while they were looking stedfastly into heaven as he went, behold two men stood by them in white apparel; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye looking into heaven? this [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], who was received up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye beheld him going into heaven.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is nigh unto Jerusalem, a sabbath dayâ€™s journey off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And when they were come in, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were abiding; both Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> These all with one accord continued stedfastly in prayer, with the women, and Maryam the mother of [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], and with his brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And in these days Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren, and said (and there was a multitude of persons gathered together, about a hundred and twenty), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Brethren, it was needful that the scripture should be fulfilled, which the Holy Ruach spoke before by the mouth of David (Dawad) concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For he was numbered among us, and received his portion in this ministry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> (Now this man obtained a field with the reward of his iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And it became known to all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that in their language that field was called Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For it is written in the book of Psalms,
<br>
Let his habitation be made desolate,
<br>
And let no man dwell therein:
<br>
and, His office let another take.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Of the men therefore that have companied with us all the time that HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]went in and went out among us, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> beginning from the total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3) of John, unto the day that he was received up from us, of these must one become a witness with us of his resurrection.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And they put forward two, Yosef called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, show of these two the one whom thou hast chosen, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas fell away, that he might go to his own place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
