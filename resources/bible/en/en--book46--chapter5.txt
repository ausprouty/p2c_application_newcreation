<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one of you hath his fatherâ€™s wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> in the name of our Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Your glorying is not good.
<br>
 Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened.
<br>
 For our passover [T.N.This verse reminds us of  the Exodus and the Passover and Isa the Qurbani Lamb of Isaiah 53:7 and John 1:29 and John 19:14-16 and the fact that Khalq Jadeed (New Creation) submitters to God bear witness that prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh is the ransom of all Ibrahim's heirs and our momentous sacrifice raised to God as a warning of the Day of Meeting in order that God might put away our evil prone flesh and bring us to God as his new creation.] also hath been sacrificed, even al-Masih: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> not at all meaning with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But them that are without Elokim judgeth.
<br>
 Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.
