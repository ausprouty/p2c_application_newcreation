<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; set to Al-tashheth. A Psalm of Dawad.
<br>
 Michtam) Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness?
<br>
Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Nay, in heart ye work wickedness;
<br>
Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The wicked are estranged from the womb:
<br>
They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent:
<br>
They are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Which hearkeneth not to the voice of charmers,
<br>
Charming never so wisely.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Break their teeth, O Elokim, in their mouth:
<br>
Break out the great teeth of the young lions, O تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Let them melt away as water that runneth apace:
<br>
When he aimeth his arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Let them be as a snail which melteth and passeth away,
<br>
Like the untimely birth of a woman, that hath not seen the sun.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Before your pots can feel the thorns,
<br>
He will take them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance:
<br>
He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> So that men shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous:
<br>
Verily there is a Elokim that judgeth in the earth.
