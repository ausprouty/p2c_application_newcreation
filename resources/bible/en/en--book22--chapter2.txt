<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I am a rose of Sharon,
<br>
A lily of the valleys.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> As a lily among thorns,
<br>
So is my love among the daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood,
<br>
So is my beloved among the sons.
<br>
I sat down under his shadow with great delight,
<br>
And his fruit was sweet to my taste.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He brought me to the banqueting-house,
<br>
And his banner over me was love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Stay ye me with raisins, refresh me with apples;
<br>
For I am sick from love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> His left hand is under my head,
<br>
And his right hand doth embrace me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
<br>
By the roes, or by the hinds of the field,
<br>
That ye stir not up, nor awake my love,
<br>
Until he please.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh,
<br>
Leaping upon the mountains,
<br>
Skipping upon the hills.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> My beloved is like a roe or a young hart:
<br>
Behold, he standeth behind our wall;
<br>
He looketh in at the windows;
<br>
He glanceth through the lattice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> My beloved spoke, and said unto me,
<br>
Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For, lo, the winter is past;
<br>
The rain is over and gone;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The flowers appear on the earth;
<br>
The time of the singing of birds is come,
<br>
And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The fig-tree ripeneth her green figs,
<br>
And the vines are in blossom;
<br>
They give forth their fragrance.
<br>
Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock,
<br>
In the covert of the steep place,
<br>
Let me see thy countenance,
<br>
Let me hear thy voice;
<br>
For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Take us the foxes, the little foxes,
<br>
That spoil the vineyards;
<br>
For our vineyards are in blossom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> My beloved is mine, and I am his:
<br>
He feedeth his flock among the lilies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away,
<br>
Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart
<br>
Upon the mountains of Bether.
<br>
