<sup class="versenum">1</sup> *And the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop thy word toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> and say to the land of Israel, Thus saith تتراجراماتون: Behold, I am against thee, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and all flesh shall know that I, تتراجراماتون, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Sigh therefore, thou son of man; with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness shalt thou sigh before their eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Wherefore sighest thou? that thou shalt say, Because of the tidings, for it cometh; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it cometh, and it shall be done, saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the word of تتراجراماتون came unto me, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith تتراجراماتون: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it contemneth every tree.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And it is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yea, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Cry and wail, son of man; for it is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; smite therefore upon thy thigh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that contemneth shall be no more? saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite thy hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one that is deadly wounded, which entereth into their chambers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Gather thee together, go to the right, set thyself in array, go to the left, whithersoever thy face is set.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, تتراجراماتون, have spoken it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The word of تتراجراماتون came unto me again, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Also, thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they twain shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Thou shalt appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows to and fro, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths unto them; but he bringeth iniquity to remembrance, that they may be taken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Therefore thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And thou, O deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day is come, in the time of the iniquity of the end, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون: Remove the mitre, and take off the crown; this shall be no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say thou, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> while they see for thee false visions, while they divine lies unto thee, to lay thee upon the necks of the wicked that are deadly wounded, whose day is come in the time of the iniquity of the end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> Cause it to return into its sheath.
<br>
 In the place where thou wast created, in the land of thy birth, will I judge thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee; I will blow upon thee with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver thee into the hand of brutish men, skilful to destroy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt be no more remembered: for I, تتراجراماتون, have spoken it.
