<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> the word of تتراجراماتون came expressly untoEzekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of تتراجراماتون was there upon him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures.
<br>
 And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> and every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings thus: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And their faces and their wings were separate above; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches: the fire went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto a beryl: and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> When they went, they went in their four directions: they turned not when they went.
<br>
 :<sup class="versenum">18</sup> As for their rims, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rims full of eyes round about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the terrible crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host: when they stood, they let down their wings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone; and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.
<br>
 This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
 And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.
