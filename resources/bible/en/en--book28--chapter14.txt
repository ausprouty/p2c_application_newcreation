<sup class="versenum">1</sup> O Israel, return unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Take with you words, and return unto تتراجراماتون: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and accept that which is good: so will we render as bullocks the offering of our lips.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses; neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our Elokim; for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the grain, and blossom as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have answered, and will regard him: I am like a green fir-tree; from me is thy fruit found.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Who is wise, that he may understand these things? prudent, that he may know them? for the ways of تتراجراماتون are right, and the just shall walk in them; but transgressors shall fall therein.
