<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I say the truth in al-Masih, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Ruach,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For I could wish that I myself were anathema from al-Masih for my brethren’s sake, my kinsmen according to the flesh: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of Elokim, and the promises; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> whose are the fathers, and of whom is al-Masih as concerning the flesh, who is over all, Elokim blessed for ever [T.N. See Isaiah 9:6 and Zechariah 12:8-10, where Messiah and his House will be like Elokim, like the angel of تتراجراماتون ; also see Daniel 7:13-14 which says all peoples with "serve as deity" the Messiah; see Daniel 3:12 which uses the same word, meaning Messiah is not an idol and is divine and not a mere man; also see Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41].
<br>
 Amen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> But it is not as though the word of Elokim hath come to nought.
<br>
 For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> neither, because they are Ibrahim (Abraham)’s seed, are they all children: but, In Ishaq (Isaac) shall thy seed be called.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> That is, it is not the children of the flesh that are children of Elokim; but the children of the promise are reckoned for a seed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For this is a word of promise, According to this season will I come, and Sarah shall have a son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And not only so; but Rebecca also having conceived by one, even by our father Ishaq (Isaac)’ 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> for the children being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of Elokim according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Even as it is written, Ya’qub (Jacob) I loved, but Esau I hated.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with Elokim? Elokim forbid.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For he saith to Musa, I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of Elokim that hath mercy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, For this very purpose did I raise thee up, that I might show in thee my power, and that my name might be published abroad in all the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> So then he hath mercy on whom he will, and whom he will he hardeneth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he still find fault? For who withstandeth his will? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against Elokim? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why didst thou make me thus? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Or hath not the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel unto honor, and another unto dishonor? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> What if Elokim, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering vessels of wrath fitted unto destruction: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he afore prepared unto glory, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> even us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> As he saith also in Hosea,
<br>
I will call that my people, which was not my people;
<br>
And her beloved, that was not beloved.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And it shall be, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people,
<br>
There shall they be called sons of the living Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> And Isaiah crieth concerning Israel, If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> for HaAdon will execute his word upon the earth, finishing it and cutting it short.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And, as Isaiah hath said before,
<br>
Except HaAdon of Sabaoth had left us a seed,
<br>
We had become as Sodom, and had been made like unto Gomorrah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who followed not after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, did not arrive at that law.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Wherefore? Because they sought it not by faith, but as it were by works.
<br>
 They stumbled at the stone of stumbling; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> even as it is written,
<br>
Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence:
<br>
And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.
