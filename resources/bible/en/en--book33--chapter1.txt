<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The word of تتراجراماتون that came to Micah the Morashtite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hear, ye peoples, all of you; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let HaAdon تتراجراماتون be witness against you, HaAdon from his holy temple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For, behold, تتراجراماتون cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And the mountains shall be melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, as waters that are poured down a steep place.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For the transgression of Ya’qub (Jacob) is all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel.
<br>
 What is the transgression of Ya’qub (Jacob)? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Therefore I will make Samaria as a heap of the field, and as places for planting vineyards; and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will uncover the foundations thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And all her graven images shall be beaten to pieces, and all her hires shall be burned with fire, and all her idols will I lay desolate; for of the hire of a harlot hath she gathered them, and unto the hire of a harlot shall they return.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For this will I lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked; I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a lamentation like the ostriches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For her wounds are incurable; for it is come even unto Judah; it reacheth unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Tell it not in Gath, weep not at all: at Beth-le-aphrah have I rolled myself in the dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Pass away, O inhabitant of Shaphir, in nakedness and shame: the inhabitant of Zaanan is not come forth; the wailing of Beth-ezel shall take from you the stay thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For the inhabitant of Maroth waiteth anxiously for good, because evil is come down from تتراجراماتون unto the gate of Jerusalem.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Bind the chariot to the swift steed, O inhabitant of Lachish: she was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion; for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Therefore shalt thou give a parting gift to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib shall be a deceitful thing unto the kings of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> I will yet bring unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, him that shall possess thee: the glory of Israel shall come even unto Adullam.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Make thee bald, and cut off thy hair for the children of thy delight: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.
