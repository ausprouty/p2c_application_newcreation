<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; set to Shushan Eduth. Michtam of Dawad, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand) O Elokim thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down;
<br>
Thou hast been angry; oh restore us again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thou hast made the land to tremble; thou hast rent it:
<br>
Heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thou hast showed thy people hard things:
<br>
Thou hast made us to drink the wine of staggering.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee,
<br>
That it may be displayed because of the truth.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> That thy beloved may be delivered,
<br>
Save with thy right hand, and answer us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Elokim hath spoken in his holiness: I will exult;
<br>
I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine;
<br>
Ephraim also is the defence of my head;
<br>
Judah is my sceptre.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Moab is my washpot;
<br>
Upon Edom will I cast my shoe:
<br>
Philistia, shout thou because of me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Who will bring me into the strong city?
<br>
Who hath led me unto Edom?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Hast not thou, O Elokim, cast us off?
<br>
And thou goest not forth, O Elokim, with our hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Give us help against the adversary;
<br>
For vain is the help of man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Through Elokim we shall do valiantly;
<br>
For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.
