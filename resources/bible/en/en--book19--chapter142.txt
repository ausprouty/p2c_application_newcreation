<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(Maschil of Dawad, when he was in the cave; a Prayer) I cry with my voice unto تتراجراماتون;
<br>
With my voice unto تتراجراماتون do I make supplication.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I pour out my complaint before him;
<br>
I show before him my trouble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> When my spirit was overwhelmed within me,
<br>
Thou knewest my path.
<br>
In the way wherein I walk
<br>
Have they hidden a snare for me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Look on my right hand, and see;
<br>
For there is no man that knoweth me:
<br>
Refuge hath failed me;
<br>
No man careth for my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I cried unto thee, O تتراجراماتون;
<br>
I said, Thou art my refuge,
<br>
My portion in the land of the living.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Attend unto my cry;
<br>
For I am brought very low:
<br>
Deliver me from my persecutors;
<br>
For they are stronger than I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Bring my soul out of prison,
<br>
That I may give thanks unto thy name:
<br>
The righteous shall compass me about;
<br>
For thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
