<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations, whither تتراجراماتون thy Elokim hath driven thee,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> and shalt return unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, and shalt obey his voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> that then تتراجراماتون thy Elokim will turn thy captivity, and have compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the peoples, whither تتراجراماتون thy Elokim hath scattered thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> If any of thine outcasts be in the uttermost parts of heaven, from thence will تتراجراماتون thy Elokim gather thee, and from thence will he fetch thee: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and تتراجراماتون thy Elokim will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And تتراجراماتون thy Elokim will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love تتراجراماتون thy Elokim with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And تتراجراماتون thy Elokim will put all these curses upon thine enemies, and on them that hate thee, that persecuted thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And thou shalt return and obey the voice of تتراجراماتون, and do all his commandments which I command thee this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And تتراجراماتون thy Elokim will make thee plenteous in all the work of thy hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy ground, for good: for تتراجراماتون will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> if thou shalt obey the voice of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if thou turn unto تتراجراماتون thy Elokim with all thy heart, and with all thy soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> in that I command thee this day to love تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that thou mayest live and multiply, and that تتراجراماتون thy Elokim may bless thee in the land whither thou goest in to possess it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But if thy heart turn away, and thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away, and worship other Elokim, and serve them; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish; ye shall not prolong your days in the land, whither thou passest over the Jordan to go in to possess it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that thou mayest live, thou and thy seed; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> to love تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, to obey his voice, and to cleave unto him; for he is thy life, and the length of thy days; that thou mayest dwell in the land which تتراجراماتون sware unto thy fathers, to Ibrahim (Abraham), to Ishaq (Isaac), and to Ya’qub (Jacob), to give them.
