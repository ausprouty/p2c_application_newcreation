<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Thus HaAdon تتراجراماتون showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord تتراجراماتون, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Ya’qub (Jacob) stand? for he is small.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> تتراجراماتون repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thus HaAdon تتراجراماتون showed me: and, behold, HaAdon تتراجراماتون called to contend by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Then said I, O Lord تتراجراماتون, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Ya’qub (Jacob) stand? for he is small.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> تتراجراماتون repented concerning this: this also shall not be, saith HaAdon تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Thus he showed me: and, behold, HaAdon stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line.
<br>
 Then said HaAdon, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> and the high places of Ishaq (Isaac) shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> and تتراجراماتون took me from following the flock, and تتراجراماتون said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Now therefore hear thou the word of تتراجراماتون: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Ishaq (Isaac); 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> therefore thus saith تتراجراماتون: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.
