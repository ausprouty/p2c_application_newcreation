<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High
<br>
Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> I will say of تتراجراماتون, He is my refuge and my fortress;
<br>
My Elokim, in whom I trust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For he will deliver thee from the snare of the fowler,
<br>
And from the deadly pestilence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He will cover thee with his pinions,
<br>
And under his wings shalt thou take refuge:
<br>
His truth is a shield and a buckler.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night,
<br>
Nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For the pestilence that walketh in darkness,
<br>
Nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> A thousand shall fall at thy side,
<br>
And ten thousand at thy right hand;
<br>
But it shall not come nigh thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold,
<br>
And see the reward of the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For thou, O تتراجراماتون, art my refuge!
<br>
Thou hast made the Most High thy habitation;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> There shall no evil befall thee,
<br>
Neither shall any plague come nigh thy tent.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For he will give his angels charge over thee,
<br>
To keep thee in all thy ways.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> They shall bear thee up in their hands,
<br>
Lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder:
<br>
The young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample under foot.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him:
<br>
I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> He shall call upon me, and I will answer him;
<br>
I will be with him in trouble:
<br>
I will deliver him, and honor him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> With long life will I satisfy him,
<br>
And show him my salvation.
