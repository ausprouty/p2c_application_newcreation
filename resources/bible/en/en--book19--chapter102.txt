<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed, and poureth out his complaint before تتراجراماتون.) Hear my prayer, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And let my cry come unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress:
<br>
Incline thine ear unto me;
<br>
In the day when I call answer me speedily.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For my days consume away like smoke,
<br>
And my bones are burned as a firebrand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> My heart is smitten like grass, and withered;
<br>
For I forget to eat my bread.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> By reason of the voice of my groaning
<br>
My bones cleave to my flesh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I am like a pelican of the wilderness;
<br>
I am become as an owl of the waste places.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I watch, and am become like a sparrow
<br>
That is alone upon the house-top.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Mine enemies reproach me all the day;
<br>
They that are mad against me do curse by me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For I have eaten ashes like bread,
<br>
And mingled my drink with weeping,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Because of thine indignation and thy wrath:
<br>
For thou hast taken me up, and cast me away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> My days are like a shadow that declineth;
<br>
And I am withered like grass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But thou, O تتراجراماتون, wilt abide for ever;
<br>
And thy memorial name unto all generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thou wilt arise, and have mercy upon Zion;
<br>
For it is time to have pity upon her,
<br>
Yea, the set time is come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For thy servants take pleasure in her stones,
<br>
And have pity upon her dust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> So the nations shall fear the name of تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And all the kings of the earth thy glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For تتراجراماتون hath built up Zion;
<br>
He hath appeared in his glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> He hath regarded the prayer of the destitute,
<br>
And hath not despised their prayer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> This shall be written for the generation to come;
<br>
And a people which shall be created shall praise تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary;
<br>
From heaven did تتراجراماتون behold the earth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> To hear the sighing of the prisoner;
<br>
To loose those that are appointed to death;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> That men may declare the name of تتراجراماتون in Zion,
<br>
And his praise in Jerusalem;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> When the peoples are gathered together,
<br>
And the kingdoms, to serve تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> He weakened my strength in the way;
<br>
He shortened my days.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> I said, O my Elokim, take me not away in the midst of my days:
<br>
Thy years are throughout all generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Of old didst thou lay the foundation of the earth;
<br>
And the heavens are the work of thy hands.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> They shall perish, but thou shalt endure;
<br>
Yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
<br>
As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> But thou art the same,
<br>
And thy years shall have no end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> The children of thy servants shall continue,
<br>
And their seed shall be established before thee.
