<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Hear ye the word which تتراجراماتون speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> thus saith تتراجراماتون, Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For the customs of the peoples are vanity; for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman with the axe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> They are like a palm-tree, of turned work, and speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go.
<br>
 Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither is it in them to do good.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> There is none like unto thee, O تتراجراماتون; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Who should not fear thee, O King of the nations? for to thee doth it appertain; forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their royal estate, there is none like unto thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But they are together brutish and foolish: the instruction of idols! it is but a stock.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> There is silver beaten into plates, which is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the artificer and of the hands of the goldsmith; blue and purple for their clothing; they are all the work of skilful men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But تتراجراماتون is the true Elokim; he is the living Elokim, and an everlasting King: at his wrath the earth trembleth, and the nations are not able to abide his indignation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Thus shall ye say unto them, The Elokim that have not made the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth, and from under the heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding hath he stretched out the heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Every man is become brutish and is without knowledge; every goldsmith is put to shame by his graven image; for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The portion of Ya’qub (Jacob) is not like these; for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance: تتراجراماتون of hosts is his name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Gather up thy wares out of the land, O thou that abidest in the siege.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For thus saith تتراجراماتون, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and will distress them, that they may feel it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Woe is me because of my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is my grief, and I must bear it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth from me, and they are not: there is none to spread my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not inquired of تتراجراماتون: therefore they have not prospered, and all their flocks are scattered.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The voice of tidings, behold, it cometh, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> O تتراجراماتون, I know that the way of man is not in himself; it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> O تتراجراماتون, correct me, but in measure; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name; for they have devoured Ya’qub (Jacob), yea, they have devoured him and consumed him, and have laid waste his habitation.
