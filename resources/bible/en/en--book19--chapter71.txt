<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In thee, O تتراجراماتون, do I take refuge:
<br>
Let me never be put to shame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Deliver me in thy righteousness, and rescue me:
<br>
Bow down thine ear unto me, and save me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Be thou to me a rock of habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:
<br>
Thou hast given commandment to save me;
<br>
For thou art my rock and my fortress.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Rescue me, O my Elokim, out of the hand of the wicked,
<br>
Out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For thou art my hope, O Lord تتراجراماتون:
<br>
Thou art my trust from my youth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> By thee have I been holden up from the womb;
<br>
Thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels:
<br>
My praise shall be continually of thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I am as a wonder unto many;
<br>
But thou art my strong refuge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> My mouth shall be filled with thy praise,
<br>
And with thy honor all the day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Cast me not off in the time of old age;
<br>
Forsake me not when my strength faileth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For mine enemies speak concerning me;
<br>
And they that watch for my soul take counsel together,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Saying, Elokim hath forsaken him:
<br>
Pursue and take him; for there is none to deliver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> O Elokim, be not far from me;
<br>
O my Elokim, make haste to help me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Let them be put to shame and consumed that are adversaries to my soul;
<br>
Let them be covered with reproach and dishonor that seek my hurt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> But I will hope continually,
<br>
And will praise thee yet more and more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness,
<br>
And of thy salvation all the day;
<br>
For I know not the numbers thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I will come with the mighty acts of HaAdon تتراجراماتون:
<br>
I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> O Elokim, thou hast taught me from my youth;
<br>
And hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Yea, even when I am old and grayheaded, O Elokim, forsake me not,
<br>
Until I have declared thy strength unto the next generation,
<br>
Thy might to every one that is to come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thy righteousness also, O Elokim, is very high;
<br>
Thou who hast done great things, O Elokim, who is like unto thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Thou, who hast showed us many and sore troubles,
<br>
Wilt quicken us again,
<br>
And wilt bring us up again from the depths of the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Increase thou my greatness,
<br>
And turn again and comfort me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> I will also praise thee with the psaltery,
<br>
Even thy truth, O my Elokim:
<br>
Unto thee will I sing praises with the harp,
<br>
O thou Holy One of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> My lips shall shout for joy when I sing praises unto thee;
<br>
And my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long;
<br>
For they are put to shame, for they are confounded, that seek my hurt.
