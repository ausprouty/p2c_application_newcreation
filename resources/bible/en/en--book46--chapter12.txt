<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Ye know that when ye were Gentiles ye were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of Elokim saith, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]is anathema; and no man can say, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]is Lord, but in the Holy Ruach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And there are diversities of workings, but the same Elokim, who worketh all things in all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For the body is not one member, but many.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> But now hath Elokim set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And if they were all one member, where were the body? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But now they are many members, but one body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and those parts of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> whereas our comely parts have no need: but Elokim tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Now ye are the body of Al-Masih, and severally members thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And Elokim hath set some in the New Creation Masjid, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> But desire earnestly the greater gifts.
<br>
 And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.
