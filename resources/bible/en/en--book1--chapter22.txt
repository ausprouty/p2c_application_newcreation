<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that Elokim did prove Ibrahim (Abraham), and said unto him, Ibrahim (Abraham); and he said, Here am I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Ishaq (Isaac), and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup></sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Ishaq (Isaac) his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which Elokim had told him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> On the third day Ibrahim (Abraham) lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Ishaq (Isaac) his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Ishaq (Isaac) spoke unto Ibrahim (Abraham) his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son.
<br>
 And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) said, Elokim will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son: so they went both of them together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And they came to the place which Elokim had told him of; and Ibrahim (Abraham) built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Ishaq (Isaac) his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون called unto him out of heaven, and said, Ibrahim (Abraham), Ibrahim (Abraham): and he said, Here am I.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know that thou fearest Elokim, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns: and Ibrahim (Abraham) went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And Ibrahim (Abraham) called the name of that place تتراجراماتون-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of تتراجراماتون it shall be provided.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And the angel of تتراجراماتون called unto Ibrahim (Abraham) a second time out of heaven, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and said, By myself have I sworn, saith تتراجراماتون, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> So Ibrahim (Abraham) returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Ibrahim (Abraham) dwelt at Beer-sheba.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Ibrahim (Abraham), saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor:<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Ibrahim (Abraham)’s brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.
