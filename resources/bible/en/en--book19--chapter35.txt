<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(A Psalm of Dawad) Strive thou, O تتراجراماتون, with them that strive with me:
<br>
Fight thou against them that fight against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Take hold of shield and buckler,
<br>
And stand up for my help.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that pursue me:
<br>
Say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Let them be put to shame and brought to dishonor that seek after my soul:
<br>
Let them be turned back and confounded that devise my hurt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Let them be as chaff before the wind,
<br>
And the angel of تتراجراماتون driving them on.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Let their way be dark and slippery,
<br>
And the angel of تتراجراماتون pursuing them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit;
<br>
Without cause have they digged a pit for my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Let destruction come upon him unawares;
<br>
And let his net that he hath hid catch himself:
<br>
With destruction let him fall therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And my soul shall be joyful in تتراجراماتون:
<br>
It shall rejoice in his salvation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> All my bones shall say, تتراجراماتون, who is like unto thee,
<br>
Who deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him,
<br>
Yea, the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Unrighteous witnesses rise up;
<br>
They ask me of things that I know not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> They reward me evil for good,
<br>
To the bereaving of my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:
<br>
I afflicted my soul with fasting;
<br>
And my prayer returned into mine own bosom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I behaved myself as though it had been my friend or my brother:
<br>
I bowed down mourning, as one that bewaileth his mother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together:
<br>
The abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not;
<br>
They did tear me, and ceased not:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Like the profane mockers in feasts,
<br>
They gnashed upon me with their teeth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Lord, how long wilt thou look on?
<br>
Rescue my soul from their destructions,
<br>
My darling from the lions.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I will give thee thanks in the great assembly:
<br>
I will praise thee among much people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me;
<br>
Neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> For they speak not peace;
<br>
But they devise deceitful words against them that are quiet in the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me;
<br>
They said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Thou hast seen it, O تتراجراماتون; keep not silence:
<br>
O Lord, be not far from me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Stir up thyself, and awake to the justice due unto me,
<br>
Even unto my cause, my Elokim and my Lord.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Judge me, O تتراجراماتون my Elokim, according to thy righteousness;
<br>
And let them not rejoice over me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Let them not say in their heart, Aha, so would we have it:
<br>
Let them not say, We have swallowed him up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Let them be put to shame and confounded together that rejoice at my hurt:
<br>
Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor that magnify themselves against me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favor my righteous cause:
<br>
Yea, let them say continually, تتراجراماتون be magnified,
<br>
Who hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness
<br>
And of thy praise all the day long.
