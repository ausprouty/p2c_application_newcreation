<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair;
<br>
Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil.
<br>
Thy hair is as a flock of goats,
<br>
That lie along the side of mount Gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes that are newly shorn,
<br>
Which are come up from the washing,
<br>
Whereof every one hath twins,
<br>
And none is bereaved among them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet,
<br>
And thy mouth is comely.
<br>
Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate
<br>
Behind thy veil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thy neck is like the tower of David (Dawad) builded for an armory,
<br>
Whereon there hang a thousand bucklers,
<br>
All the shields of the mighty men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Thy two breasts are like two fawns
<br>
That are twins of a roe,
<br>
Which feed among the lilies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away,
<br>
I will get me to the mountain of myrrh,
<br>
And to the hill of frankincense.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Thou art all fair, my love;
<br>
And there is no spot in thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Come with me from Lebanon, my bride,
<br>
With me from Lebanon:
<br>
Look from the top of Amana,
<br>
From the top of Senir and Hermon,
<br>
From the lionsâ€™ dens,
<br>
From the mountains of the leopards.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride;
<br>
Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes,
<br>
With one chain of thy neck.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride!
<br>
How much better is thy love than wine!
<br>
And the fragrance of thine oils than all manner of spices!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Thy lips, O my bride, drop as the honeycomb:
<br>
Honey and milk are under thy tongue;
<br>
And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> A garden shut up is my sister, my bride;
<br>
A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thy shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with precious fruits;
<br>
Henna with spikenard plants,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Spikenard and saffron,
<br>
Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense;
<br>
Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thou art a fountain of gardens,
<br>
A well of living waters,
<br>
And flowing streams from Lebanon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south;
<br>
Blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out.
<br>
Let my beloved come into his garden,
<br>
And eat his precious fruits.
