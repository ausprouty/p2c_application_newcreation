<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle: the things that ye carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary beast.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Hearken unto me, O house of Yaâ€™qub (Jacob), and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne by me from their birth, that have been carried from the womb; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and even to old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you; I have made, and I will bear; yea, I will carry, and will deliver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Such as lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, they hire a goldsmith, and he maketh it a Elokim; they fall down, yea, they worship.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> They bear it upon the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it standeth, from its place shall it not remove: yea, one may cry unto it, yet can it not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Remember the former things of old: for I am Elokim, and there is none else; I am Elokim, and there is none like me; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.
