<sup class="versenum">1</sup></sup>(For the Chief Musician.
<br>
 A Psalm of Dawad) Hold not thy peace, O Elokim of my praise;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of deceit have they opened against me:
<br>
They have spoken unto me with a lying tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> They have compassed me about also with words of hatred,
<br>
And fought against me without a cause.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For my love they are my adversaries:
<br>
But I give myself unto prayer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And they have rewarded me evil for good,
<br>
And hatred for my love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Set thou a wicked man over him;
<br>
And let an adversary stand at his right hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> When he is judged, let him come forth guilty;
<br>
And let his prayer be turned into sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Let his days be few;
<br>
And let another take his office.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Let his children be fatherless,
<br>
And his wife a widow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Let his children be vagabonds, and beg;
<br>
And let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Let the extortioner catch all that he hath;
<br>
And let strangers make spoil of his labor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Let there be none to extend kindness unto him;
<br>
Neither let there be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Let his posterity be cut off;
<br>
In the generation following let their name be blotted out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with تتراجراماتون;
<br>
And let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Let them be before تتراجراماتون continually,
<br>
That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Because he remembered not to show kindness,
<br>
But persecuted the poor and needy man,
<br>
And the broken in heart, to slay them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Yea, he loved cursing, and it came unto him;
<br>
And he delighted not in blessing, and it was far from him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment,
<br>
And it came into his inward parts like water,
<br>
And like oil into his bones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covereth himself,
<br>
And for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> This is the reward of mine adversaries from تتراجراماتون,
<br>
And of them that speak evil against my soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> But deal thou with me, O تتراجراماتون HaAdon, for thy name’s sake:
<br>
Because thy lovingkindness is good, deliver thou me;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For I am poor and needy,
<br>
And my heart is wounded within me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> I am gone like the shadow when it declineth:
<br>
I am tossed up and down as the locust.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> My knees are weak through fasting;
<br>
And my flesh faileth of fatness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> I am become also a reproach unto them:
<br>
When they see me, they shake their head.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Help me, O تتراجراماتون my Elokim;
<br>
Oh save me according to thy lovingkindness:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> That they may know that this is thy hand;
<br>
That thou, تتراجراماتون, hast done it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Let them curse, but bless thou:
<br>
When they arise, they shall be put to shame,
<br>
But thy servant shall rejoice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Let mine adversaries be clothed with dishonor,
<br>
And let them cover themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> I will give great thanks unto تتراجراماتون with my mouth;
<br>
Yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> For he will stand at the right hand of the needy,
<br>
To save him from them that judge his soul.
