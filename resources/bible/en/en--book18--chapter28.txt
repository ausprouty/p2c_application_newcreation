<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Surely there is a mine for silver,
<br>
And a place for gold which they refine.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Iron is taken out of the earth,
<br>
And copper is molten out of the stone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Man setteth an end to darkness,
<br>
And searcheth out, to the furthest bound,
<br>
The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn;
<br>
They are forgotten of the foot;
<br>
They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> As for the earth, out of it cometh bread;
<br>
And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> The stones thereof are the place of sapphires,
<br>
And it hath dust of gold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> That path no bird of prey knoweth,
<br>
Neither hath the falconâ€™s eye seen it:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> The proud beasts have not trodden it,
<br>
Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock;
<br>
He overturneth the mountains by the roots.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He cutteth out channels among the rocks;
<br>
And his eye seeth every precious thing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He bindeth the streams that they trickle not;
<br>
And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> But where shall wisdom be found?
<br>
And where is the place of understanding?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Man knoweth not the price thereof;
<br>
Neither is it found in the land of the living.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> The deep saith, It is not in me;
<br>
And the sea saith, It is not with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> It cannot be gotten for gold,
<br>
Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir,
<br>
With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Gold and glass cannot equal it,
<br>
Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal:
<br>
Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it,
<br>
Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Whence then cometh wisdom?
<br>
And where is the place of understanding?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,
<br>
And kept close from the birds of the heavens.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Destruction and Death say,
<br>
We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Elokim understandeth the way thereof,
<br>
And he knoweth the place thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> For he looketh to the ends of the earth,
<br>
And seeth under the whole heaven;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> To make a weight for the wind:
<br>
Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> When he made a decree for the rain,
<br>
And a way for the lightning of the thunder;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Then did he see it, and declare it;
<br>
He established it, yea, and searched it out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> And unto man he said,
<br>
Behold, the fear of HaAdon, that is wisdom;
<br>
And to depart from evil is understanding.
