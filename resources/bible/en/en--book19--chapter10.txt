<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Why standest thou afar off, O تتراجراماتون?
<br>
Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued;
<br>
Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire,
<br>
And the covetous renounceth, yea, contemneth تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, saith, He will not require it.
<br>
All his thoughts are, There is no Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> His ways are firm at all times;
<br>
Thy judgments are far above out of his sight:
<br>
As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved;
<br>
To all generations I shall not be in adversity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression:
<br>
Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages;
<br>
In the secret places doth he murder the innocent;
<br>
His eyes are privily set against the helpless.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert;
<br>
He lieth in wait to catch the poor:
<br>
He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He croucheth, he boweth down,
<br>
And the helpless fall by his strong ones.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He saith in his heart: Elokim hath forgotten;
<br>
He hideth his face, he will never see it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Arise, O تتراجراماتون; O Elokim, lift up thy hand:
<br>
Forget not the poor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn Elokim,
<br>
And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require it?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand:
<br>
The helpless committeth himself unto thee;
<br>
Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Break thou the arm of the wicked;
<br>
And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> تتراجراماتون is King for ever and ever:
<br>
The nations are perished out of his land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> تتراجراماتون, thou hast heard the desire of the meek:
<br>
Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed,
<br>
That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.
