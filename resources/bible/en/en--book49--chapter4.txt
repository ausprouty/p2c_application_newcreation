<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> I therefore, the prisoner in HaAdon, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> There is one body, and one Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> one Lord, one faith, one total immersion death ghusl burial (see ultimate meaning, Romans 6:3), 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> one Elokim and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Al-Masih.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Wherefore he saith,
<br>
When he ascended on high,
<br>
he led captivity captive,
<br>
And gave gifts unto men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> (Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And he gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, mevaserim (T.N. See 2 Timothy 4:5); and some, pastors and teachers; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Al-Masih: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of Elokim [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)], unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Al-Masih: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, even Al-Masih; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in due measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> This I say therefore, and testify in HaAdon, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of Elokim, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But ye did not so learn Al-Masih; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> if so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and put on the new man, that after Elokim hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> neither give place to the devil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And grieve not the Holy Ruach of Elokim, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as [Atik Yomin] Elokim also in [Bar Enosh] al-Masih forgave you.
