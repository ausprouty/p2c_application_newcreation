<sup class="versenum">1</sup> How hath HaAdon covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger!
<br>
He hath cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel,
<br>
And hath not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> HaAdon hath swallowed up all the habitations of Ya’qub (Jacob), and hath not pitied:
<br>
He hath thrown down in his wrath the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;
<br>
He hath brought them down to the ground; he hath profaned the kingdom and the princes thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> He hath cut off in fierce anger all the horn of Israel;
<br>
He hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy:
<br>
And he hath burned up Ya’qub (Jacob) like a flaming fire, which devoureth round about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> He hath bent his bow like an enemy, he hath stood with his right hand as an adversary,
<br>
And hath slain all that were pleasant to the eye:
<br>
In the tent of the daughter of Zion he hath poured out his wrath like fire.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> HaAdon is become as an enemy, he hath swallowed up Israel;
<br>
He hath swallowed up all her palaces, he hath destroyed his strongholds;
<br>
And he hath multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden; he hath destroyed his place of assembly:
<br>
تتراجراماتون hath caused solemn assembly and sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,
<br>
And hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> HaAdon hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary;
<br>
He hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces:
<br>
They have made a noise in the house of تتراجراماتون, as in the day of a solemn assembly.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> تتراجراماتون hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion;
<br>
He hath stretched out the line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying;
<br>
And he hath made the rampart and wall to lament; they languish together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars:
<br>
Her king and her princes are among the nations where the law is not;
<br>
Yea, her prophets find no vision from تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, they keep silence;
<br>
They have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth:
<br>
The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Mine eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled;
<br>
My liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,
<br>
Because the young children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine?
<br>
When they swoon as the wounded in the streets of the city,
<br>
When their soul is poured out into their mothers’ bosom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> What shall I testify unto thee? what shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem?
<br>
What shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion?
<br>
For thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thy prophets have seen for thee false and foolish visions;
<br>
And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity,
<br>
But have seen for thee false oracles and causes of banishment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> All that pass by clap their hands at thee;
<br>
They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,
<br>
Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee;
<br>
They hiss and gnash the teeth; they say, We have swallowed her up;
<br>
Certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> تتراجراماتون hath done that which he purposed; he hath fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old;
<br>
He hath thrown down, and hath not pitied:
<br>
And he hath caused the enemy to rejoice over thee; he hath exalted the horn of thine adversaries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Their heart cried unto HaAdon:
<br>
O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night;
<br>
Give thyself no respite; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches;
<br>
Pour out thy heart like water before the face of HaAdon:
<br>
Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> See, O تتراجراماتون, and behold to whom thou hast done thus!
<br>
Shall the women eat their fruit, the children that are dandled in the hands?
<br>
Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of HaAdon?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The youth and the old man lie on the ground in the streets;
<br>
My virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword:
<br>
Thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast slaughtered, and not pitied.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Thou hast called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side;
<br>
And there was none that escaped or remained in the day of تتراجراماتون’s anger:
<br>
Those that I have dandled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed.
