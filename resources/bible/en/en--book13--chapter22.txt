<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then David (Dawad) said, This is the house of تتراجراماتون Elokim, and this is the altar of burnt-offering for Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And David (Dawad) commanded to gather together the sojourners that were in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And David (Dawad) prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the couplings; and brass in abundance without weight; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and cedar-trees without number: for the Sidonians and they of Tyre brought cedar-trees in abundance to David (Dawad).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And David (Dawad) said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the house that is to be builded for تتراجراماتون must be exceeding magnificent, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will therefore make preparation for it.
<br>
 So David (Dawad) prepared abundantly before his death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build a house for تتراجراماتون, the Elokim of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And David (Dawad) said to Solomon his son, As for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of تتراجراماتون my Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But the word of تتراجراماتون came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build a house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about; for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> he shall build a house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Now, my son, تتراجراماتون be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim, as he hath spoken concerning thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Only تتراجراماتون give thee discretion and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel; that so thou mayest keep the law of تتراجراماتون thy Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Then shalt thou prosper, if thou observe to do the statutes and the ordinances which تتراجراماتون charged Musa with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; fear not, neither be dismayed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Now, behold, in my affliction I have prepared for the house of تتراجراماتون a hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver, and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all men that are skilful in every manner of work: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is no number.
<br>
 Arise and be doing, and تتراجراماتون be with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> David (Dawad) also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Is not تتراجراماتون your Elokim with you? and hath he not given you rest on every side? for he hath delivered the inhabitants of the land into my hand; and the land is subdued before تتراجراماتون, and before his people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Now set your heart and your soul to seek after تتراجراماتون your Elokim; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of تتراجراماتون Elokim, to bring the ark of the covenant of تتراجراماتون, and the holy vessels of Elokim, into the house that is to be built to the name of تتراجراماتون.
