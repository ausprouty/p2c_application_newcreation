<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of Elokim and of the Lamb,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> in the midst of the street thereof.
<br>
 And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve manner of fruits, yielding its fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And there shall be no curse any more: and the throne of Elokim and of the Lamb shall be therein: and his servants shall serve him; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> and they shall see his face; and his name shall be on their foreheads.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And there shall be night no more; and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun; for HaAdon Elokim shall give them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and HaAdon, the Elokim of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And behold, I come quickly.
<br>
 Blessed is he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And I John am he that heard and saw these things.
<br>
 And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel that showed me these things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And he saith unto me, See thou do it not: I am a fellow-servant with thee and with thy brethren the prophets, and with them that keep the words of this book: worship Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And he saith unto me, Seal not up the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> He that is unrighteous, let him do unrighteousness still: and he that is filthy, let him be made filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him do righteousness still: and he that is holy, let him be made holy still.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to each man according as his work is.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have the right to come to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates into the city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Without are the dogs, and the sorcerers, and the fornicators, and the murderers, and the idolaters, and every one that loveth and maketh a lie.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> I [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things for the New Creation Masjid.
<br>
 I am the root and the Tzemach (see Zechariah 6:11-12) of David (Dawad), the bright, the morning star.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the Spirit and the bride say, Come.
<br>
 And he that heareth, let him say, Come.
<br>
 And he that is athirst, let him come: he that will, let him take the water of life freely.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto them, Elokim shall add unto him the plagues which are written in this book: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, Elokim shall take away his part from the tree of life, and out of the holy city, which are written in this book.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> He who testifieth these things saith, Yea: I come quickly. Amen: come, Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> The grace of HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]be with the saints.
