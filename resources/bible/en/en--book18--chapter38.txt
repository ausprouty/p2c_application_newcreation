<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Then تتراجراماتون answered Ayyub (Job) out of the whirlwind, and said,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Who is this that darkeneth counsel
<br>
By words without knowledge?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Gird up now thy loins like a man;
<br>
For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
<br>
Declare, if thou hast understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest?
<br>
Or who stretched the line upon it?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened?
<br>
Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> When the morning stars sang together,
<br>
And all the sons of Elokim shouted for joy?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Or who shut up the sea with doors,
<br>
When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> When I made clouds the garment thereof,
<br>
And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And marked out for it my bound,
<br>
And set bars and doors,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further;
<br>
And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began,
<br>
And caused the dayspring to know its place;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> That it might take hold of the ends of the earth,
<br>
And the wicked be shaken out of it?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> It is changed as clay under the seal;
<br>
And all things stand forth as a garment:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And from the wicked their light is withholden,
<br>
And the high arm is broken.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?
<br>
Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee?
<br>
Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth?
<br>
Declare, if thou knowest it all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Where is the way to the dwelling of light?
<br>
And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof,
<br>
And that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Doubtless, thou knowest, for thou wast then born,
<br>
And the number of thy days is great!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow,
<br>
Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Which I have reserved against the time of trouble,
<br>
Against the day of battle and war?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> By what way is the light parted,
<br>
Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood,
<br>
Or the way for the lightning of the thunder;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> To cause it to rain on a land where no man is;
<br>
On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> To satisfy the waste and desolate ground,
<br>
And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Hath the rain a father?
<br>
Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> Out of whose womb came the ice?
<br>
And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> The waters hide themselves and become like stone,
<br>
And the face of the deep is frozen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades,
<br>
Or loose the bands of Orion?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season?
<br>
Or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens?
<br>
Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds,
<br>
That abundance of waters may cover thee?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go,
<br>
And say unto thee, Here we are?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?
<br>
Or who hath given understanding to the mind?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> Who can number the clouds by wisdom?
<br>
Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> When the dust runneth into a mass,
<br>
And the clods cleave fast together?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">39</sup> Canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness,
<br>
Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">40</sup> When they couch in their dens,
<br>
And abide in the covert to lie in wait?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">41</sup> Who provideth for the raven his prey,
<br>
When his young ones cry unto Elokim,
<br>
And wander for lack of food?
<br>
