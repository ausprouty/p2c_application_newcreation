<sup class="versenum">1</sup> When Israel went forth out of Egypt,
<br>
The house of Ya’qub (Jacob) from a people of strange language;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Judah became his sanctuary,
<br>
Israel his dominion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> The sea saw it, and fled;
<br>
The Jordan was driven back.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> The mountains skipped like rams,
<br>
The little hills like lambs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> What aileth thee, O thou sea, that thou fleest?
<br>
Thou Jordan, that thou turnest back?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Ye mountains, that ye skip like rams;
<br>
Ye little hills, like lambs?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of HaAdon,
<br>
At the presence of the Elokim of Ya’qub (Jacob),
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Who turned the rock into a pool of water,
<br>
The flint into a fountain of waters.
