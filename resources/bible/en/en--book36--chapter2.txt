<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation that hath no shame;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce anger of تتراجراماتون come upon you, before the day of تتراجراماتون’s anger come upon you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Seek ye تتراجراماتون, all ye meek of the earth, that have kept his ordinances; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye will be hid in the day of تتراجراماتون’s anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of تتراجراماتون is against you, O Canaan, the land of the Philistines; I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the sea-coast shall be pastures, with cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed their flocks thereupon; in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening; for تتراجراماتون their Elokim will visit them, and bring back their captivity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Therefore as I live, saith تتراجراماتون of hosts, the Elokim of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and saltpits, and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall make a prey of them, and the remnant of my nation shall inherit them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> تتراجراماتون will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the Elokim of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one from his place, even all the isles of the nations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry like the wilderness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And herds shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the nations: both the pelican and the porcupine shall lodge in the capitals thereof; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar-work.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> This is the joyous city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none besides me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.
