<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Let love of the brethren continue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Forget not to show love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are ill-treated, as being yourselves also in the body.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Let marriage be had in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers Elokim will judge.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> So that with good courage we say,
<br>
HaAdon is my helper; I will not fear:
<br>
What shall man do unto me?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spoke unto you the word of Elokim; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] is the same yesterday and to-day, yea and for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned without the camp.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Wherefore [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after the city which is to come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to Elokim continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices Elokim is well pleased.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this were unprofitable for you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Now the Elokim of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, even our Lord [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh],  
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation: for I have written unto you in few words.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.
<br>
 They of Italy salute you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> Grace be with you all. Amen.
