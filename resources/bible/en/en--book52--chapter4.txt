<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Finally then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], that, as ye received of us how ye ought to walk and to please Elokim, even as ye do walk,â€™that ye abound more and more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> For ye know what charge we gave you through HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For this is the will of Elokim, even your sanctification, that ye abstain from fornication; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> that each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel in sanctification and honor, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> that no man transgress, and wrong his brother in the matter: because HaAdon is an avenger in all these things, as also we forewarned you and testified.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For Elokim called us not for uncleanness, but in sanctification.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Therefore he that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but Elokim, who giveth his Holy Ruach unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> But concerning love of the brethren ye have no need that one write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of Elokim to love one another; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> for indeed ye do it toward all the brethren that are in all Macedonia.
<br>
 But we exhort you, brethren, that ye abound more and more; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> and that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your hands, even as we charged you; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> that ye may walk becomingly toward them that are without, and may have need of nothing.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that fall asleep; that ye sorrow not, even as the rest, who have no hope.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For if we believe that [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]died and rose again, even so them also that are fallen asleep in [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]will Elokim bring with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For this we say unto you by the word of HaAdon, that we that are alive, that are left unto the coming of HaAdon, shall in no wise precede them that are fallen asleep.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For HaAdon himself shall descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of Elokim: and the dead in Al-Masih shall rise first; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> then we that are alive, that are left, shall together with them be caught up in the clouds, to meet HaAdon in the air: and so shall we ever be with HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Wherefore comfort one another with these words.
