<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the harlot.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and put out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Among the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot; even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation.
<br>
 Shall I be appeased for these things? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed; thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast uncovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them: thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And thou wentest to the king with oil, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto Sheol.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, It is in vain: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and thou fearest me not? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I will declare thy righteousness; and as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> When thou criest, let them that thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that taketh refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And he will say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls that I have made.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him; I hid my face and was wroth; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith تتراجراماتون; and I will heal him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> There is no peace, saith my Elokim, to the wicked.
