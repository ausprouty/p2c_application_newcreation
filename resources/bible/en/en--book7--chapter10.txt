<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged Israel twenty and two years.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of تتراجراماتون, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the Elokim of Syria, and the Elokim of Sidon, and the Elokim of Moab, and the Elokim of the children of Ammon, and the Elokim of the Philistines; and they forsook تتراجراماتون, and served him not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the anger of تتراجراماتون was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the children of Ammon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year: eighteen years oppressed they all the children of Israel that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And the children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the children of Israel cried unto تتراجراماتون, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our Elokim, and have served the Baalim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto the children of Israel, Did not I save you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried unto me, and I saved you out of their hand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other Elokim: wherefore I will save you no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Go and cry unto the Elokim which ye have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And the children of Israel said unto تتراجراماتون, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; only deliver us, we pray thee, this day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And they put away the foreign Elokim from among them, and served تتراجراماتون; and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead.
<br>
 And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpah.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And the people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
