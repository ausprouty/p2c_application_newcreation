<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Behold what manner of love the [Atik Yomin] Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of Elokim; and such we are.
<br>
 For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Beloved, now are we children of Elokim, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> My little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of Elokim manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Whosoever is begotten of Elokim doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of Elokim [T.N. Some might debase the meaning here to infer God's physical paternity of a believer in a sexual procreational sense, as many also misunderstand the Virgin birth of the Only Begotten Incarnate Son of God, as if some blasphemous sexual thing were impuned against God.  But God is Spirit (John 4:24), and the Holy Seed of new spiritual life is spiritually implanted in the believer, making sin incompatible with the believer's new creation personhood thus spiritually conceived.  There is no thought of sexual begetting in either sonship, however, either in the case of ours as New Creation Submitters to God, or, for that matter, in the case of the Bar Enosh, who was always and eternally in a Son to Father relationship with the Atik Yomin. Now if someone asserts that the Bar Enosh could not take on human form and that the Incarnation itself is impossible, one needs only to look at Genesis 18 where God himself in a human body is literally eating with Abrahim in his tent.. Let God's word be true and every man a liar (Romans 3:4) See the Hebrew word for possess in Proverbs 8:22 where تتراجراماتون possessed His Eternal Word who came to Maryam, John 1:1-14, as the Bar Enosh from the Atik Yomin, whom New Creation Muslims submit to and look for; see John 3:3,12-15; Luke 18:31-33; Matthew 17:9; 13:41. [Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17). And this Son of God took on flesh as the Son of God Messiah (Psalm 2:7; 1 Chronicles 17:13; Isaiah 7:14; Isaiah 9:5-6), David's Lord (Psalm 110:1). And whoever calls on the Name of the Lord will be saved (Joel 2:32). God's Word, His Son, incarnated as the Son of God Messiah, has a prophesied Name. His prophesied Name is Yeshua given through Messiah's Namesake Yeshua the High Priest who made the kaporah in 516 BCE ending the Golus (Exile) of abandonment from God (Isaiah 54:7) lasting 70 years from 586 BCE to 516 BCE. Yeshua is the Kohen after the order of Melki-Tzedek (Ps 110:4) who in his abandonment (Matthew 27:46) made the kaporah ending our Exile from God, our exile of sin and death (Matt. 1:12-17)]
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> In this the children of Elokim are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of Elokim, neither he that loveth not his brother.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother.
<br>
 And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of Elokim abide in him? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> My little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> because if our heart condemn us, Elokim is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> and whatsoever we ask we receive of him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh, see Daniel 7:13-14], and love one another, even as he gave us commandment [T.N. Only through God's Word can we know God's salvation (Psalm 119:81; 2 Tim 3:15). God's Son (Proverbs 30:4), the source of revelation (Proverbs 30:3-5) and love (Proverbs 8:17), functioned as an Amon (Craftsman, master builder, Proverbs 8:30) or Creative Wisdom at His side as the source of creativity (Proverbs 8:12; 8:22; 8:30) and love (Proverbs 8:17).

<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.
