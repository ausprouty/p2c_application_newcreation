<sup class="versenum">1</sup> So these three men ceased to answer Ayyub (Job), because he was righteous in his own eyes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Ayyub (Job) was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Ayyub (Job).
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Ayyub (Job), because they were elder than he.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said,
<br>
I am young, and ye are very old;
<br>
Wherefore I held back, and durst not show you mine opinion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> I said, Days should speak,
<br>
And multitude of years should teach wisdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> But there is a spirit in man,
<br>
And the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> It is not the great that are wise,
<br>
Nor the aged that understand justice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Therefore I said, Hearken to me;
<br>
I also will show mine opinion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> Behold, I waited for your words,
<br>
I listened for your reasonings,
<br>
Whilst ye searched out what to say.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Yea, I attended unto you,
<br>
And, behold, there was none that convinced Ayyub (Job),
<br>
Or that answered his words, among you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom;
<br>
Elokim may vanquish him, not man:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> For he hath not directed his words against me;
<br>
Neither will I answer him with your speeches.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> They are amazed, they answer no more:
<br>
They have not a word to say.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And shall I wait, because they speak not,
<br>
Because they stand still, and answer no more?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> I also will answer my part,
<br>
I also will show mine opinion.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For I am full of words;
<br>
The spirit within me constraineth me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Behold, my breast is as wine which hath no vent;
<br>
Like new wine-skins it is ready to burst.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> I will speak, that I may be refreshed;
<br>
I will open my lips and answer.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Let me not, I pray you, respect any manâ€™s person;
<br>
Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For I know not to give flattering titles;
<br>
Else would my Maker soon take me away.
