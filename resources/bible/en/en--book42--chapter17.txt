<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And he said unto his disciples, It is impossible but that occasions of stumbling should come; but woe unto him, through whom they come!
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> It were well for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were thrown into the sea, rather than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother sin, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And if he sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the apostles said unto HaAdon, Increase our faith.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And HaAdon said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye would say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea; and it would obey you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But who is there of you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say unto him, when he is come in from the field, Come straightway and sit down to meat; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> and will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Doth he thank the servant because he did the things that were commanded? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Even so ye also, when ye shall have done all the things that are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which it was our duty to do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And it came to pass, as they were on the way to Jerusalem, that he was passing along the borders of Samaria and Galilee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> and they lifted up their voices, saying, [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], Master, have mercy on us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go and show yourselves unto the priests.
<br>
 And it came to pass, as they went, they were cleansed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> and he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh]answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but where are the nine? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Were there none found that returned to give glory to Elokim, save this stranger? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And he said unto him, Arise, and go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of Elokim cometh, he answered them and said, The kingdom of Elokim cometh not with observation: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> neither shall they say, Lo, here! or, There! for lo, the kingdom of Elokim is within you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Bar Enosh, and ye shall not see it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> And they shall say to you, Lo, there! Lo, here! go not away, nor follow after them: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> for as the lightning, when it lighteneth out of the one part under the heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall the Bar Enosh be in his day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> But first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And as it came to pass in the days of Noah, even so shall it be also in the days of the Bar Enosh.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> Likewise even as it came to pass in the days of Lut (Lot); they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> but in the day that Lut (Lot) went out from Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> after the same manner shall it be in the day that the Bar Enosh is revealed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> In that day, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and let him that is in the field likewise not return back.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Remember Lutâ€™s (Lot's) wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Whosoever shall seek to gain his life shall lose it: but whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> I say unto you, In that night there shall be two men on one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
<br>
 ::<sup class="versenum">35</sup> There shall be two women grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> Two will be in the field; one will be taken and the other left. 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And they answering say unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body is, thither will the eagles also be gathered together.
