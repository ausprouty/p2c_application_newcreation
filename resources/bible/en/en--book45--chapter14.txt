<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> But him that is weak in faith receive ye, yet not for decision of scruples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for Elokim hath received him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth.
<br>
 Yea, he shall be made to stand; for HaAdon hath power to make him stand.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike.
<br>
 Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto HaAdon: and he that eateth, eateth unto HaAdon, for he giveth Elokim thanks; and he that eateth not, unto HaAdon he eateth not, and giveth Elokim thanks.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For whether we live, we live unto HaAdon; or whether we die, we die unto HaAdon: whether we live therefore, or die, we are HaAdon’s.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For to this end Al-Masih died and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> For it is written,
<br>
As I live, saith HaAdon, to me every knee shall bow,
<br>
And every tongue shall confess to Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> So then each one of us shall give account of himself to Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> I know, and am persuaded in HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love.
<br>
 Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Al-Masih died.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Let not then your good be evil spoken of: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> for the kingdom of Elokim is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ruach.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> For he that herein serveth Al-Masih is well-pleasing to Elokim, and approved of men.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of Elokim.
<br>
 All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before Elokim.
<br>
 Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
