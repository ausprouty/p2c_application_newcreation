<sup class="versenum">1</sup> The burden of Egypt.
<br>
Behold, تتراجراماتون rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh unto Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek unto the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith HaAdon, تتراجراماتون of hosts.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and become dry.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And the rivers shall become foul; the streams of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up; the reeds and flags shall wither away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And the fishers shall lament, and all they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Moreover they that work in combed flax, and they that weave white cloth, shall be confounded.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And the pillars of Egypt shall be broken in pieces; all they that work for hire shall be grieved in soul.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Where then are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now; and let them know what تتراجراماتون of hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Memphis are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, that are the corner-stone of her tribes.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> تتراجراماتون hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> In that day shall the Egyptians be like unto women; and they shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of تتراجراماتون of hosts, which he shaketh over them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And the land of Judah shall become a terror unto Egypt; every one to whom mention is made thereof shall be afraid, because of the purpose of تتراجراماتون of hosts, which he purposeth against it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to تتراجراماتون of hosts; one shall be called The city of destruction.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> In that day shall there be an altar to تتراجراماتون in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto تتراجراماتون of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto تتراجراماتون because of oppressors, and he will send them a saviour, and a defender, and he will deliver them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> And تتراجراماتون shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know تتراجراماتون in that day; yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and oblation, and shall vow a vow unto تتراجراماتون, and shall perform it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> And تتراجراماتون will smite Egypt, smiting and healing; and they shall return unto تتراجراماتون, and he will be entreated of them, and will heal them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> for that تتراجراماتون of hosts hath blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.
