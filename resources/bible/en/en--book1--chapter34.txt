<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she bare unto Ya’qub (Jacob), went out to see the daughters of the land.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> And Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her; and he took her, and lay with her, and humbled her.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Ya’qub (Jacob), and he loved the damsel, and spoke kindly unto the damsel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Shechem spoke unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Now Ya’qub (Jacob) heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter; and his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Ya’qub (Jacob) held his peace until they came.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Ya’qub (Jacob) to commune with him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And the sons of Ya’qub (Jacob) came in from the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Ya’qub’s daughter; which thing ought not to be done.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you, give her unto him to wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And make ye marriages with us; give your daughters unto us, and take our daughters unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find favor in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And the sons of Ya’qub (Jacob) answered Shechem and Hamor his father with guile, and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach unto us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Only on this condition will we consent unto you: if ye will be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor’s son.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Ya’qub’s daughter: and he was honored above all the house of his father.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their city, and communed with the men of their city, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land, and trade therein; for, behold, the land is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Only on this condition will the men consent unto us to dwell with us, to become one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as they are circumcised.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Shall not their cattle and their substance and all their beasts be ours? only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore, that two of the sons of Ya’qub (Jacob), Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city unawares, and slew all the males.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went forth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> The sons of Ya’qub (Jacob) came upon the slain, and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> They took their flocks and their herds and their asses, and that which was in the city, and that which was in the field; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> and all their wealth, and all their little ones and their wives, took they captive and made a prey, even all that was in the house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And Ya’qub (Jacob) said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me, to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and, I being few in number, they will gather themselves together against me and smite me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?
