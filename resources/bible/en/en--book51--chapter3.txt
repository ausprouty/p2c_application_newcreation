<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> If then ye were raised together with Al-Masih, seek the things that are above, where Al-Masih is, seated on the right hand of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> For ye died, and your life is hid with Al-Masih in Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> When Al-Masih, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of Elokim upon the sons of disobedience: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> wherein ye also once walked, when ye lived in these things; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> but now do ye also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> and have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Al-Masih is all, and in all.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Put on therefore, as Elokim’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as HaAdon forgave you, so also do ye: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> And let the peace of Al-Masih rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Let the word of Al-Masih dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of HaAdon [Prophet] Isa [al-Masih pbuh], giving thanks to Elokim the Father through him.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing HaAdon: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto HaAdon, and not unto men; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> knowing that from HaAdon ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the al-Masih HaAdon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
