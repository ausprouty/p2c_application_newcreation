<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup> These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> It is the glory of Elokim to conceal a thing;
<br>
But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth,
<br>
So the heart of kings is unsearchable.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Take away the dross from the silver,
<br>
And there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Take away the wicked from before the king,
<br>
And his throne shall be established in righteousness.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Put not thyself forward in the presence of the king,
<br>
And stand not in the place of great men:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> For better is it that it be said unto thee, Come up hither,
<br>
Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince,
<br>
Whom thine eyes have seen.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Go not forth hastily to strive,
<br>
Lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof,
<br>
When thy neighbor hath put thee to shame.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Debate thy cause with thy neighbor himself,
<br>
And disclose not the secret of another;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Lest he that heareth it revile thee,
<br>
And thine infamy turn not away.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> A word fitly spoken
<br>
Is like apples of gold in network of silver.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold,
<br>
So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> As the cold of snow in the time of harvest,
<br>
So is a faithful messenger to them that send him;
<br>
For he refresheth the soul of his masters.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> As clouds and wind without rain,
<br>
So is he that boasteth himself of his gifts falsely.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded,
<br>
And a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
<br>
Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbor’s house,
<br>
Lest he be weary of thee, and hate thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> A man that beareth false witness against his neighbor
<br>
Is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble
<br>
Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> As one that taketh off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon soda,
<br>
So is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat;
<br>
And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> For thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head,
<br>
And تتراجراماتون will reward thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> The north wind bringeth forth rain;
<br>
So doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop,
<br>
Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> As cold waters to a thirsty soul,
<br>
So is good news from a far country.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> As a troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring,
<br>
So is a righteous man that giveth way before the wicked.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> It is not good to eat much honey;
<br>
So for men to search out their own glory is grievous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> He whose spirit is without restraint
<br>
Is like a city that is broken down and without walls.
