<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Praise ye تتراجراماتون.
<br>
Blessed is the man that feareth تتراجراماتون,
<br>
That delighteth greatly in his commandments.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> His seed shall be mighty upon earth:
<br>
The generation of the upright shall be blessed.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> Wealth and riches are in his house;
<br>
And his righteousness endureth for ever.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness:
<br>
He is gracious, and merciful, and righteous.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Well is it with the man that dealeth graciously and lendeth;
<br>
He shall maintain his cause in judgment.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> For he shall never be moved;
<br>
The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> He shall not be afraid of evil tidings:
<br>
His heart is fixed, trusting in تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> His heart is established, he shall not be afraid,
<br>
Until he see his desire upon his adversaries.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> He hath dispersed, he hath given to the needy;
<br>
His righteousness endureth for ever:
<br>
His horn shall be exalted with honor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> The wicked shall see it, and be grieved;
<br>
He shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away:
<br>
The desire of the wicked shall perish.
