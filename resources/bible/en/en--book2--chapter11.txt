<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Yet one plague more will I bring upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And تتراجراماتون gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.
<br>
 Moreover the man Musa was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants, and in the sight of the people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And Musa said, Thus saith تتراجراماتون, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt:

<sup class="versenum">5</sup> and all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even unto the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of cattle.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath not been, nor shall be any more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how that تتراجراماتون doth make a distinction between the Egyptians and Israel.

<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And all these thy servants shall come down unto me, and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that follow thee: and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Pharaoh will not hearken unto you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Musa and Haron (Aaron) did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and تتراجراماتون hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the children of Israel go out of his land.
