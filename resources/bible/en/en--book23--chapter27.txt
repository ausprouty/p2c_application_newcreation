<sup class="versenum">1</sup> In that day تتراجراماتون with his hard and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the swift serpent, and leviathan the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster that is in the sea.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> In that day: A vineyard of wine, sing ye unto it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I تتراجراماتون am its keeper; I will water it every moment: lest any hurt it, I will keep it night and day.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Wrath is not in me: would that the briers and thorns were against me in battle! I would march upon them, I would burn them together.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> Or else let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace with me; yea, let him make peace with me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> In days to come shall Ya’qub (Jacob) take root; Israel shall blossom and bud; and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Hath he smitten them as he smote those that smote them? or are they slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by them? 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> In measure, when thou sendest them away, thou dost contend with them; he hath removed them with his rough blast in the day of the east wind.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Ya’qub (Jacob) be forgiven, and this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: that he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder, so that the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come, and set them on fire; for it is a people of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have compassion upon them, and he that formed them will show them no favor.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, that تتراجراماتون will beat off his fruit from the flood of the River unto the brook of Egypt; and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great trumpet shall be blown; and they shall come that were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and they that were outcasts in the land of Egypt; and they shall worship تتراجراماتون in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.
