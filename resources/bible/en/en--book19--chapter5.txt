<sup class="versenum">1</sup> (For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of Dawad) Give ear to my words, O تتراجراماتون,
<br>
Consider my meditation.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my Elokim;
<br>
For unto thee do I pray.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> O تتراجراماتون, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice;
<br>
In the morning will I order my prayer unto thee, and will keep watch.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For thou art not a Elokim that hath pleasure in wickedness:
<br>
Evil shall not sojourn with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight:
<br>
Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies:
<br>
تتراجراماتون abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house:
<br>
In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Lead me, O تتراجراماتون, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
<br>
Make thy way straight before my face.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth;
<br>
Their inward part is very wickedness;
<br>
Their throat is an open sepulchre;
<br>
They flatter with their tongue.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> Hold them guilty, O Elokim;
<br>
Let them fall by their own counsels;
<br>
Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions;
<br>
For they have rebelled against thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice,
<br>
Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them:
<br>
Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> For thou wilt bless the righteous;
<br>
O تتراجراماتون, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.
<br>
