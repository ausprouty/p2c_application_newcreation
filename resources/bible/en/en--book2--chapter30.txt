<sup class="versenum">1</sup> And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon: of acacia wood shalt thou make it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> A cubit shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof; foursquare shall it be; and two cubits shall be the height thereof: the horns thereof shall be of one piece with it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> And two golden rings shalt thou make for it under the crown thereof; upon the two ribs thereof, upon the two sides of it shalt thou make them; and they shall be for places for staves wherewith to bear it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> And thou shalt make the staves of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> And thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat that is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> And Haron (Aaron) shall burn thereon incense of sweet spices: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn it.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> And when Haron (Aaron) lighteth the lamps at even, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before تتراجراماتون throughout your generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-offering, nor meal-offering; and ye shall pour no drink-offering thereon.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And Haron (Aaron) shall make atonement upon the horns of it once in the year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations: it is most holy unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel, according to those that are numbered of them, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto تتراجراماتون, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> This they shall give, every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary; (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an offering to تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Every one that passeth over unto them that are numbered, from twenty years old and upward, shall give the offering of تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less, than the half shekel, when they give the offering of تتراجراماتون, to make atonement for your souls.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> And thou shalt take the atonement money from the children of Israel, and shalt appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting; that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before تتراجراماتون, to make atonement for your souls.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> And تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> Thou shalt also make a laver of brass, and the base thereof of brass, whereat to wash.
<br>
 And thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and thou shalt put water therein.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> And Haron (Aaron) and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet thereat:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> when they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they die not; or when they come near to the altar to minister, to burn an offering made by fire unto تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they die not: and it shall be a statute for ever to them, even to him and to his seed throughout their generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> Moreover تتراجراماتون spoke unto Musa, saying, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> Take thou also unto thee the chief spices: of flowing myrrh five hundred shekels, and of sweet cinnamon half so much, even two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus two hundred and fifty, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And thou shalt make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded after the art of the perfumer: it shall be a holy anointing oil.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> And thou shalt anoint therewith the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> and the table and all the vessels thereof, and the candlestick and the vessels thereof, and the altar of incense,
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> and the altar of burnt-offering with all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> And thou shalt sanctify them, that they may be most holy: whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> And thou shalt anoint Haron (Aaron) and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">31</sup> And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be a holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">32</sup> Upon the flesh of man shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make any like it, according to the composition thereof: it is holy, and it shall be holy unto you.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">33</sup> Whosoever compoundeth any like it, or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">34</sup> And تتراجراماتون said unto Musa, Take unto thee sweet spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense: of each shall there be a like weight; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">35</sup> and thou shalt make of it incense, a perfume after the art of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">36</sup> and thou shalt beat some of it very small, and put of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">37</sup> And the incense which thou shalt make, according to the composition thereof ye shall not make for yourselves: it shall be unto thee holy for تتراجراماتون.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">38</sup> Whosoever shall make like unto that, to smell thereof, he shall be cut off from his people.
