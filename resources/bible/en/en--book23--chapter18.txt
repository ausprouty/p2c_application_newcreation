<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Ah, the land of the rustling of wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia;
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> that sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of papyrus upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation tall and smooth, to a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide! 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when an ensign is lifted up on the mountains, see ye; and when the trumpet is blown, hear ye.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> For thus hath تتراجراماتون said unto me, I will be still, and I will behold in my dwelling-place, like clear heat in sunshine, like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> For before the harvest, when the blossom is over, and the flower becometh a ripening grape, he will cut off the sprigs with pruning-hooks, and the spreading branches will he take away and cut down.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> They shall be left together unto the ravenous birds of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth; and the ravenous birds shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> In that time shall a present be brought unto تتراجراماتون of hosts from a people tall and smooth, even from a people terrible from their beginning onward, a nation that meteth out and treadeth down, whose land the rivers divide, to the place of the name of تتراجراماتون of hosts, the mount Zion.
