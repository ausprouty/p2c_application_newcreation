<div class = "bible">
<sup class="versenum">1</sup>(For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph) I will cry unto Elokim with my voice, Even unto Elokim with my voice; and he will give ear unto me.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> In the day of my trouble I sought HaAdon:
<br>
My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not;
<br>
My soul refused to be comforted.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I remember Elokim, and am disquieted:
<br>
I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed.
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> Thou holdest mine eyes watching:
<br>
I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> I have considered the days of old,
<br>
The years of ancient times.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> I call to remembrance my song in the night:
<br>
I commune with mine own heart;
<br>
And my spirit maketh diligent search.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> Will HaAdon cast off for ever?
<br>
And will he be favorable no more?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever?
<br>
Doth his promise fail for evermore?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> Hath Elokim forgotten to be gracious?
<br>
Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> And I said, This is my infirmity;
<br>
But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> I will make mention of the deeds of تتراجراماتون;
<br>
For I will remember thy wonders of old.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> I will meditate also upon all thy work,
<br>
And muse on thy doings.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> Thy way, O Elokim, is in the sanctuary:
<br>
Who is a great Elokim like unto Elokim?
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> Thou art the Elokim that doest wonders:
<br>
Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people,
<br>
The sons of Ya’qub (Jacob) and Yusuf (Joseph).
<br>
Selah
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> The waters saw thee, O Elokim;
<br>
The waters saw thee, they were afraid:
<br>
The depths also trembled.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> The clouds poured out water;
<br>
The skies sent out a sound:
<br>
Thine arrows also went abroad.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind;
<br>
The lightnings lightened the world:
<br>
The earth trembled and shook.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> Thy way was in the sea,
<br>
And thy paths in the great waters,
<br>
And thy footsteps were not known.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> Thou leddest thy people like a flock,
<br>
By the hand of Musa and Haron (Aaron).
