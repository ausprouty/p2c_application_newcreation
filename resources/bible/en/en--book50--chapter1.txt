<sup class="versenum">1</sup> Paul and Timothy, servants of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], to all the saints in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
<br>
<sup class="versenum">2</sup> Grace to you and peace from Elokim our Father and HaAdon [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">3</sup> I thank my Elokim upon all my remembrance of you, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">4</sup> always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy, 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">5</sup> for your fellowship in furtherance of the Holy Injil from the first day until now; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">6</sup> being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh] 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">7</sup> even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the Holy Injil, ye all are partakers with me of grace.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">8</sup> For Elokim is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh].
<br>
<sup class="versenum">9</sup> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">10</sup> so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Al-Masih; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">11</sup> being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], unto the glory and praise of Elokim.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">12</sup> Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the Holy Injil; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">13</sup> so that my bonds became manifest in Al-Masih throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">14</sup> and that most of the brethren in HaAdon, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of Elokim without fear.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">15</sup> Some indeed preach Al-Masih even of envy and strife; and some also of good will: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">16</sup> the one do it of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the Holy Injil; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">17</sup> but the other proclaim Al-Masih of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">18</sup> What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Al-Masih is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">19</sup> For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh], 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">20</sup> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Al-Masih shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">21</sup> For to me to live is Al-Masih, and to die is gain [T.N. See the leper as good as dead, cut off as in a leprosy asylum in 2 Kings 5:14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of Elokim; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. Here we see that God can welcome you as a khalq jadeed member of the ummah of the redeemed, for old things have passed away and the leprous you has died and the newborn you has been raised up with prophet Isa al-Masih pbuh from the khalq jadeed death ghusl water burial (Romans 6:3). This is the sibghah death ghusl of a khalq jadeed submitter to تتراجراماتون for if God wills He can remove the leprous old you and put in your place a new creation as it says in Sura 14:19
<br>
أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللّهَ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ بِالْحقِّ إِن يَشَأْ يُذْهِبْكُمْ وَيَأْتِ بِخَلْقٍ جَدِيد .]
<br>

<br>
<sup class="versenum">22</sup> But if to live in the flesh,’if this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">23</sup> But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Al-Masih; for it is very far better: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">24</sup> yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">25</sup> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">26</sup> that your glorying may abound in [Prophet] Isa al-Masih [pbuh]in me through my presence with you again.
<br>
<sup class="versenum">27</sup> Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Holy Injil of al-Masih: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the Holy Injil; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">28</sup> and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from Elokim; 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">29</sup> because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Al-Masih, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf: 
<br>
<sup class="versenum">30</sup> having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
